            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>You&apos;ve already started using responsive units to write high-quality stylesheets. In this
              sprint we&apos;ll expand on that knowledge by covering responsive layouts, media queries, and
              accessibility such that you can build websites to work on mobile devices too!</p>
            <p>This sprint will also introduce you to the wild world of JavaScript. We&apos;ll cover variables,
              conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. These basic skills will be crucial as you go
              on
              to create dynamic and interactive web pages during your time at Lambda School.</p>
            <h3 id="responsive-design">Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>Responsive design covers topics that range from fixed layouts to fully responsive websites.
              Responsive design addresses accessibility challenges and how developers can use flexible units to
              overcome them. On top of being accessible, fully responsive websites are a joy to use and push web
              development forward into the future.</p>
            <h3 id="intro-to-javascript">Intro to JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is the backbone of interactive web pages. This module will tackle basic syntax and
              logic
              in JavaScript including variables, math, conditionals, loops, and functions. These building blocks
              will inform the rest of your career as a web developer.</p>
            <h3 id="arrays">Arrays</h3>
            <p>Arrays allow you, the developer, to work with lots of changing data efficiently to keep code DRY.
              Arrays, combined with the programmatic logic from the previous module, provide data to webpages,
              and
              make your life as a developer, a lot easier.</p>
            <h3 id="objects">Objects</h3>
            <p>Objects are yet another data type that can be used to store a collection of data (rather than
              just
              a single value). In this module you&apos;ll explore object syntax and some basic methods to work
              with object data.</p>

            <h3 id="responsive-web-design-layouts">Responsive Web Design Layouts</h3>
            <p>Knowing the subtle nuances between responsive web design layouts will allow you to make better
              technical decisions for your apps and websites. Let&apos;s take a&#xA0;look at some design terms
              and
              how they translate into code.</p>
            <h4 id="fixed-layout">Fixed Layout</h4>
            <p>Fixed layouts are what the early web looked like. Designs usually looked good on desktop screens
              but would slowly get worse as the browser&apos;s viewport got smaller. Horizontal scroll bars were
              a
              normal feature and you would find yourself pinching and zooming all over mobile devices to read a
              website.</p>
            <p>The user experience on multiple devices is usually poor, so why are fixed designs still around
              today? Because fixed layouts are much cheaper to build and maintain.</p>
            <h5 id="features-of-fixed-layout">Features of Fixed Layout</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Design is usually desktop only.</li>
              <li>CSS widths are usually hardcoded pixels.</li>
              <li>Horizontal scroll bars appear as the viewport shrinks smaller than the website&apos;s design.
              </li>
              <li>No media queries are used.</li>
              <li>Quicker deployment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="fluid-layout">Fluid Layout</h4>
            <p>The opposite of a fixed layout is one that could expand and contract in proportion to most
              devices.
              This sounds great at first, but without constraints, you soon have to think about how your site
              will
              look on several devices with one set of styles.</p>
            <p>Some of the problems of a fluid layout include: images getting too small, buttons growing too
              large, and layouts that can grow to be way too spacious on large desktops. It&apos;s a constant
              game
              of white space and content. Fluid layouts still have a place in modern web design but are seen
              less
              frequently compared to adaptive and responsive.</p>
            <h5 id="features-of-fluid-layout">Features of Fluid Layout</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone</li>
              <li>Percent based units instead of hard coded pixels</li>
              <li>Everything is designed to proportionally shrink</li>
              <li>No media queries are used</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="adaptive-layout">Adaptive Layout</h4>
            <p>Adaptive layouts borrow from the speed of a fixed-layout but accommodate different devices at
              specific breakpoints in design. For example, an adaptive website may have hardcoded pixels used
              for
              layout using media queries for different devices.</p>
            <p>Adaptive layout is another cheap and easy way to get more content out quickly for a business to
              more devices. Adaptive layout still lacks in&#xA0;accommodating for thousands of devices because
              care was only given to specific designs at certain breakpoints. It&apos;s a lot better than fixed,
              but we can do more with a responsive layout.</p>
            <h5 id="features-of-adaptive-layout">Features of Adaptive Layout</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone</li>
              <li>Media queries are used</li>
              <li>Layout widths are still hardcoded at each media query</li>
              <li>Quick deployment for specific devices</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="responsive-layout">Responsive Layout</h4>
            <p>Responsive layouts combine features of fixed, adaptive, and fluid websites into one seamless
              experience. Media queries are used to constrain responsive units so that as the viewport expands
              or
              shrinks, you get an experience that looks and functions beautifully across thousands of devices
              and
              screen sizes.</p>
            <p>Responsive sites take more time and effort to create and are the standard long term projects
              should
              aim for.</p>
            <h5 id="features-of-responsive-layout">Features of Responsive Layout</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone.</li>
              <li>Responsive units are used throughout the site.</li>
              <li>Media queries are used.</li>
              <li>Site accommodates thousands of devices and takes longer to build.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="responsive-web-design-layout-tutorial">Responsive Web Design Layout Tutorial</h3>
            <p>Let&apos;s use the same HTML structure to showcase the differences between fixed, fluid,
              adaptive,
              and responsive layouts. You can use your own editor to follow along or just <a
                href="https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/gZwPVg?editors=1100">click this link</a> to see the
              codepen version</p>
            <p>We will use this HTML:</p>
            <pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;section class=&quot;main-content&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Layouts&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Testing out different layouts!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
            <h3 id="fixed-css">Fixed CSS</h3>
            <p>Given the HTML above, let&apos;s use the following CSS to provide some constraints and a border
              so
              we can see our <code>.container</code>.</p>
            <pre><code class="css language-css">/* Fixed Layout */
.container {
  width: 800px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid red;
  margin: 0 auto;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Notice the <code>width</code> and <code>padding</code> values are hardcoded pixels. Try resizing
              your browser and see where the horizontal scroll bars show up.</p>
            <p>This layout makes for really poor user experience if you&apos;re on a small screen or any kind of
              device that doesn&apos;t match the 800px width.</p>
            <h3 id="fluid-css">Fluid CSS</h3>
            <p>Fluid utilizes the <code>%</code> responsive unit to control layout. Notice that we have to be
              careful about the total width of the container adding up to 100%. We have to be careful to update
              both the width and padding to equal 100% or we will see horizontal scroll bars again as the
              viewport
              shrinks.</p>
            <p>Comment out the fixed CSS code from above and use our new fluid code.</p>
            <pre><code class="css language-css">/* Fluid Layout */
.container {
  width: 98%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 1px solid red;
  padding: 20px 1%;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Notice how small and how large you can resize the window without hurting the integrity of the web
              page. This simple example showcases the major visual difference between fixed and fluid.
              Let&apos;s
              take a look at how adaptive can use media queries to control layout on a specific device.</p>
            <h3 id="adaptive-css">Adaptive CSS</h3>
            <p>With adaptive layout, we are going to take the fixed layout code and apply media queries to it.
            </p>
            <p>Comment out the fluid CSS code from above and use our new adaptive code.</p>
            <pre><code class="css language-css">/* Adaptive Layout */
.container {
  width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 1px solid red;
  padding: 20px;
}
@media(max-width: 500px) {
  .container {
    width: 500px;
    background: gray;
  }
  .container header nav {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
 &amp;nbsp;.container header nav a {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
}</code></pre>
            <p>Notice how we added some&#xA0;more styles specifically for our mobile view? This process is part
              of
              how adaptive &quot;adapts&quot; to the viewport. The problem with this solution is it&apos;s still
              too rigid.</p>
            <h3 id="responsive-css">Responsive CSS</h3>
            <p>Responsive uses constraints with <code>%</code> based layouts for that seamless feeling between
              devices. For example, we can use a css property of <code>max-width</code> to control the maximum
              width of a container while also providing <code>%</code> flexibility below it. Notice how we
              changed
              <code>.container</code> to now stop growing past <code>800px</code>. Also, note that any
              horizontal
              margin or padding was converted into a responsive unit.
            </p>
            <p>These subtle changes will continue to be discussed later in this unit but for now, study the code
              and notice it&apos;s not that big of a difference when we compare our adaptive layout.</p>
            <pre><code class="css language-css">/* Responsive */
.container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 1px solid red;
&amp;nbsp; padding: 20px 1.25%;
}
@media(max-width: 500px) {
  .container {
    background: gray;
  }
  .container header nav {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
 &amp;nbsp;.container header nav a {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
}</code></pre>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>Max-width and min-width are the keys to the car when it comes to media queries. Understanding
              that
              &quot;mobile first design&quot; directly translates into min-width is a concept that many new
              developers struggle with.</p>
            <p>This simple example demonstrates the differences in max and min-width:</p>
            <p><a href="https://codepen.io/bigknell/pen/ddYKVq">https://codepen.io/bigknell/pen/ddYKVq</a></p>
            <p>Media queries use max and min width to determine where breakpoints are introduced so it&apos;s a
              big deal to make sure we understand how each works concerning the viewport.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <h3 id="what-is-accessibility">What is Accessibility?</h3>
            <p>Web accessibility, as you might expect, deals with making web pages and the internet accessible
              to
              all people, regardless of how they need to interact with the page. As web developers you should be
              designing web pages with <em>all</em> people in mind. Including, but not limited to: those with
              slow
              internet connection, those on mobile devices, those with auditory, cognitive, neurological, or
              physical disabilities,and those with visual needs. Recent studies show that up to 2.5% of all
              internet users interact with the web using a screen reader, which is a considerable number of
              people.</p>
            <h3 id="universal-design-theory">Universal Design Theory</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design">Universal design theory</a> states that
              designing with the &quot;furthest out&quot; individual in mind will end up benefiting all
              individuals who use the product or environment. This theory reaches all sorts of
              design&#x2014;web,
              architecture, learning, and more. A commonly used example of universal design theory, applied to a
              real-world problem, are ramps on sidewalks. Though they were originally designed for people who
              need
              wheelchairs, they are used and enjoyed by many others for different needs such as parents with
              children in strollers.</p>
            <p>The idea of accessibility in web originated because people with disabilities needed to be able to
              access the internet in non-traditional ways. Unsurprisingly though, designing accessible websites
              has compounding benefits and it helps a plethora of other people. For example, folks using smaller
              browser screens are positively impacted by websites designed for those who need larger font sizes.
            </p>
            <p>Other universal benefits of accessibility include designs intended for permanent physical
              impairments that help people with temporary issues (like a broken thumb) and designs intended for
              the hearing impaired, for example closed captioning, that help everyone when they&apos;re in a
              loud
              space or can&apos;t use headphones.</p>
            <h3 id="responsive-units">Responsive Units</h3>
            <p>One of the simplest ways to make sure your website is accessible is to use responsive units. We
              touched on these already, but scalable units are really important in terms of accessibility. For
              example, browsers have settings that allow users to change a page&apos;s font size, but that only
              works if the associated CSS is scalable&#x2014;REM, EM, % are all scalable.</p>
            <p>A well implemented example of this is the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">whitehouse.gov</a>
              webpage&#x2014;go ahead and play around with your browser font size, and try zooming in and out to
              see what this looks like.</p>
            <p>This same logic applies to images and buttons, or really anything and everything that you might
              style on your page.</p>
            <h3 id="screen-readers">Screen Readers</h3>
            <p>Screen readers are a great thing to keep top of mind while designing for accessibility. A screen
              reader is a tool (a browser extension or app) that transmits web page data for people with visual
              impairments, learning disabilities, or other needs; They usually operate by verbalizing the
              content
              or sometimes translating into braille. Screen readers read content based on how the HTML is coded,
              starting with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> headings, and navigating through other elements accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>As a web developer, it is important to make sure that your tags are <em>semantic</em> so that
              users
              who rely on screen readers can navigate accordingly. A webpage made entirely with
              <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for example, would provide no hierarchy to the screen reader or the user,
              and would prevent them from being able to navigate the site.
            </p>
            <p>Semantic tags typically have english meaning, like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
              <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and
              <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. Non-semantic tags are those without any english meaning, like
              <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, when designing universally, you should be sure to include meaningful id and class
              names,
              and always give your images &quot;alt&quot; text.</p>
            <h3 id="color">Color</h3>
            <p>Close to 5% of the population of the United States (about 13 million people) is colorblind. Not
              to
              mention that plenty of folks view websites in grey scale out of personal preference. Therefore,
              when
              color is used to convey an important message, the message can be lost on a lot of users.</p>
            <p>To avoid this issue, every colorfully displayed component should have a visual counterpart. A
              common example of this difference is pictured below. Here, there is a form field showing an error
              message. The top example isn&apos;t accessible but the bottom is, simply because we added a
              symbol.
            </p>
            <p><img src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/96fabbf6-aadc-4b38-8a85-a7b2bac6be3f_Slice.png"
                alt="Form Accessibility"></p>
            <p>In addition, you&apos;ll want to use colors that contrast well, and try to avoid red and green in
              general, since they are the trickiest colors for people who are colorblind.</p>
            <h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>There are entire careers dedicated to making webpages accessible, and this is just the tip of the
              iceberg. When it comes to designing for accessibility, it isn&apos;t just the right thing to do,
              in
              many cases, <a href="https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies">it&apos;s also the
                law</a>. We hope this introduction encourages you to employ universal design theory from here on
              out!</p>

            <p>Study the code below -- What&apos;s accessible? What&apos;s not? Together, we&apos;ll change the
              code to make it more accessible.</p>

            <p>One of the first things you should notice above is that every element uses a
              <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag. If a screen reader were trying to read this code, it would start
              with
              &quot;This is some text that isn&apos;t as important,&quot; instead of the title.
            </p>
            <p>We can easily change all of the divs to h1, h2, and p tags, to make it compatible with screen
              readers. That might look like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;h2 class=&quot;something&quot;&gt;This is some text that isn&apos;t as important &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;This is a title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;This is an important message!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;This is an important message!&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Instantly more accessible! Another big no-no in this pen is the hard-coded pixels. Those should
              be
              changed to responsive units. You can use the information below or use this super helpful w3

              to
              EM.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="css language-css">html{
  text-align: center;
  margin: 3%;
}
.title {
  color: blue;
  font-size:120%;
}
.something{
  font-size: 56.25%;
}</code></pre>
            <p>Finally, let&apos;s look at the <code>class</code> names. Since there is so little content on
              this
              site, it doesn&apos;t seem like that matters, but consider what would happen if we started to add
              styling, or build out whole classes. Before moving on, change the class &quot;something&quot; to
              &quot;subtitle&quot;. This helps not only screen readers, but your future developer self.</p>
            <pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;This is some text that isn&apos;t as important &lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <h3 id="what-is-javascript-and-why-do-we-use-it">What is JavaScript and why do we use it?</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that was first created in 1994 as a way to add functionality
              and interactivity to a website. If we think back to our analogy of a web page as a house, we will
              remember that we said that JavaScript is the electricity, plumbing, and gas. It is what makes the
              web page &quot;run&quot;. JavaScript was originally designed to be used purely on the front end as
              a
              way for web developers to add functionality to their web pages, and in its early days, it did just
              that. Recently, the introduction of the &quot;V8 engine&quot; by Google has improved the speed and
              functionality of JS. That led to the development and release of exciting new front end JavaScript
              frameworks and eventually Node.js, a way to run JavaScript on a server (back end). This new
              development has led to a resurgence of JavaScript. Now, JavaScript is one of the world&apos;s most
              widely-used programming languages. We can find JavaScript used on the front end, back end, mobile,
              Internet of Things (IoT), game development, and really anywhere a traditional programming language
              would be used. Though there are later versions, we will be focusing on and using JavaScript ES6 in
              this course because it is the most widely applicable.</p>
            <h4 id="javascript-vs-java-and-other-languages">JavaScript vs Java (and other languages)</h4>
            <p>Keep in mind, JavaScript is not the same as Java. Although they share similar names (this was,
              unfortunately, considered a good thing by JavaScript&apos;s early pioneers) that is where the
              similarities end.</p>
            <p>The creators of JavaScript wanted to borrow concepts from other programming languages, such as
              Scheme, Java, and C. Those of you with backgrounds in other languages may see things that look
              very
              familiar, mainly the use of classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architecture. Keep in
              mind
              that JavaScript is not a &quot;true&quot; OOP language and many things you may be familiar with
              from
              another language won&apos;t work with JavaScript.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is considered a &apos;loosely&apos; typed language, in which types do exist, but they
              are not enforced. You do not have to declare a type when creating a variable or an array, for
              instance.</p>
            <h4 id="how-to-run-javascript">How to &apos;run&apos; JavaScript</h4>
            <p>For this class, we are going to use a special code sandbox program just like we did with the last
              lesson (CodePen), called <a href="https://www.repl.it">repl.it</a>. This will allow us to write
              and
              edit our code and run it right in our browser window to see a real-time read-out.</p>
            <p>While this is one way to run your JavaScript, most JavaScript is run from a file with the
              extension
              of <code>.js</code> (e.g., <code>fileName.js</code>) and loaded into your browser via the
              <code>script</code> tag in your HTML.
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript, being the de-facto language of the Internet, can also be run directly within an
              Internet browser. In fact, you can write all of the JavaScript you want and watch it run in
              real-time right in your browser by pressing F12 (for Windows), or Cmd+option+J (for Mac) (for
              Google
              Chrome). This will open up your <em>console</em> (we will learn more about the console later).</p>

            <h3 id="hello-world">Hello World</h3>
            <p>Hello World is traditionally used to introduce programmers to a new language. The origins of this
              date back to one of the first computer languages, C, where printing the phrase &quot;hello
              world&quot; was a major victory.</p>
            <p>In JavaScript, printing &quot;Hello, World!&quot; requires just one line of code. Before you move
              on, try this example to write your first program!</p>

            <h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
            <p>At the heart of JavaScript are variables. A variable is a way to store, change and use data in
              code. To explain this concept, consider your favorite webpage: maybe it&apos;s instagram, maybe an
              online game. More than likely, there are lots of changing pieces on these pages - instagram has
              likes and usernames, a video game has character selection, game score, and many more - every one
              of
              those changing bits of data is stored in a variable. The variable called <code>score</code>, for
              example, starts with <code>0</code>, and changes every time you gather points in the game.</p>
            <p>Similarly, you might create a variable called <code>greet</code> and store the value &quot;Hello
              World&quot; to further simplify your program above to <code>console.log(greet)</code>.</p>
            <p>The syntax to create a variable is first the keyword, a space, the name we are giving the
              variable,
              an equal sign, the value we are assigning the variable, and then a semicolon. (A note for those
              with
              previous programming knowledge: JavaScript is a loosely-typed language, which means that a
              variable
              can be set, and reset, to any type. We do not need to declare its type when creating the
              variable.)
            </p>
            <p>There are <em>three</em> keywords used to declare variables -<code>var</code>, <code>let</code>,
              and <code>const</code>. Each keyword comes with slightly different use cases, mostly based around
              what happens when you change the value of the variable. Some examples of syntax are below.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">var firstName = &apos;John&apos;;
let lastName = &apos;Smith&apos;;
const favoriteFood = &apos;Taco&apos;;</code></pre>
            <h4 id="var">var</h4>
            <p><code>var</code> is the ES5 way of declaring a variable. This is a generic variable keyword.
              Variables created with var can be changed without causing errors. While that sounds like a good
              thing at first, using <code>var</code> too often might lead to buggy code.</p>
            <p>Note in the example below that once you declare the variable, you can change it without having to
              declare again. This is true with all variable keywords.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">var firstName = &apos;Alice&apos;;
firstName = &apos;Bob&apos;;        // &lt;- this would be fine</code></pre>
            <p>If <code>var</code> is commonly regarded as bad programming practice, what should we use?</p>
            <h4 id="const">const</h4>
            <p>A <code>const</code> variable is a variable that cannot be changed later in the code. It&apos;s
              short for &quot;constant&quot;. In our example above &quot;Bob&quot; could not be changed to
              &quot;Alice&quot; and would throw an error.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const firstName = &apos;Alice&apos;
firstName = &apos;Bob&apos;         // &lt;- this would cause an error</code></pre>
            <p>This fixes the bug issue, but we know that sometimes variables do need to change - like, the
              score
              of a game. Is there a better solution?</p>
            <h4 id="let">let</h4>
            <p>Enter <code>let</code>. <code>let</code> is a new ES6 variable keyword. This will assign a
              variable
              much like <code>var</code>, but with a little bit different behavior. Most notably, it differs by
              creating &quot;block level scope&quot;. For our purposes at the moment, <code>let</code> and
              <code>var</code> function almost exactly the same. When we get to writing functions and loops, we
              can start to use <code>let</code> to our advantage.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">let firstName = &apos;Alice&apos;;
firstName = &apos;Bob&apos;;</code></pre>
            <p>To recap:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>var</code> can be re-assigned and changed.</li>
              <li><code>let</code> can be re-assigned but not changed.</li>
              <li><code>const</code> cannot be re-assigned nor changed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because these three keywords achieve the same thing (storing data in memory and assigning that
              data
              a &apos;key&apos; that can be used for access) but behave very differently, there are places in
              this
              world for all three. And of course, as with everything, there are some other intricacies to learn
              about the <code>let</code> <code>const</code> and <code>var</code> keywords that we didn&apos;t
              cover here today.</p>
            <p><strong>Lambda School Rule of Thumb</strong> When defining/declaring variables <em>use const
                until
                you can&apos;t, then use let</em>.</p>
            <p>We <strong>highly</strong> recommend researching the differences between <code>var</code>,
              <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> in terms of their scoping rules as well. We&apos;ll cover
              more on this later on when talking about function vs. block scoping. But for now, I&apos;ll point
              you towards the <strong>Dig Deeper</strong> section&apos;s link, <strong>How let and const are
                scoped in JavaScript</strong>, for some further understanding here.

            <h3 id="primitive-data-types-string-number-boolean">Primitive Data Types (String, Number, Boolean)
            </h3>
            <p>Primitive data types, also known as basic data types are the simplest data types in JavaScript.
              They&apos;re sort of like primary colors in that all other data types (which we will learn about
              in
              later lessons) are made of these types.</p>
            <h4 id="strings">Strings</h4>
            <p>Strings are blocks of text. They will always be defined with quotation marks around them, either
              single or double. Any text with quotes around it (even numbers) are strings.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const dog = &apos;fido&apos;;
const string = &apos;2&apos;;</code></pre>
            <h4 id="numbers">Numbers</h4>
            <p>Numbers are just that, numbers. Numbers do NOT have quotes around them. They can be negative as
              well. JavaScript does have a limitation on the size of a number (+/- 9007199254740991), but only
              very rarely will that limitation come up.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const answer = 42;
const negative = -13;</code></pre>
            <h4 id="booleans">Booleans</h4>
            <p>Booleans are an important relic from the origins of computer science. It is a dichotomous concept
              that powers binary code, still the very core of computers. You may have seen binary code in the
              past
              (e.g., 0001 0110&#x2026;). That is Boolean logic. The only booleans in JavaScript are
              <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, traditionally written in lowercase letters. These
              variables are useful when you need to employ some kind of dichotomous (or
              &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot;) logic in your code.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const iLoveJavascript = true;
const isThisaString = false;</code></pre>
            <p>Note that while Booleans look like strings, the lack of <code>&apos;</code> around the words
              indicates that the variable is a boolean and it will work differently under the hood.</p>
            <h3 id="undefined-and-null">Undefined and Null</h3>
            <p>There are a couple of JavaScript objects that don&apos;t really fit into any type. Those are the
              values <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code>. You will get <code>undefined</code> when you
              are looking for a variable that does not have a value yet. <code>undefined</code> simply means
              what
              you are asking for does not exist.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">console.log(unkownVar); // undefined</code></pre>
            <p><code>null</code> is an object that we, the developers, set when we want to tell other developers
              that the item they are looking for exists, but there is no value associated with it. While
              <code>undefined</code> is set by the JavaScript language, <code>null</code> is set by the
              developer.
              If you ever receive <code>null</code>, it means that another developer has set that value to
              <code>null</code>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">let phoneNumber = &apos;123-456-7890&apos;;
phoneNumber = null;
phoneNumber; // null</code></pre>
            <p>One last thing to note, neither <code>undefined</code> nor <code>null</code> are strings. They
              are
              written just as they are without quotes around them, like a Boolean.</p>

            <p>Declare a variable called &apos;name&apos; with the var keyword. Give it the value of your name.
              The code below will console.log your variables. Don&apos;t touch this code!</p>
            <p>To declare a variable with var we first use the <code>var</code> keyword, followed by the name of
              our variable, <code>name</code>, and finally the value, <code>Alice</code></p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">var name = &apos;Alice&apos;;</code></pre>
            <p>Declare a variable called &apos;food&apos; with the let keyword. Give it the value of your
              favorite
              food. Declaring a variable with let works similarly to <code>var</code>, all we need to do is
              change
              the keyword to <code>let</code>. Remember that this will allow for mutability, but will show a
              warning when you try to change the value.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">let food = &apos;Pizza&apos;;</code></pre>
            <p>Declare a variable called birthMonth with the const keyword. Give it the value of your birth
              month
              (i.e. January or February). Const doesn&apos;t allow for mutability, and much like you can&apos;t
              change your birth month, you can&apos;t change the value of this variable declared with
              <code>const</code>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const birthMonth = &apos;February&apos;;</code></pre>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <h3 id="math-operators">Math Operators</h3>
            <p>Calculators were the first major computer function. In JavaScript, we have built-in math
              operators
              that work exactly as they do on your calculator.</p>
            <h4 id="standard-operators">Standard Operators</h4>
            <p>JavaScript can preform any standard operations - addition (<code>+</code>), subtraction
              (<code>-</code>), multiplication (<code>*</code>), and division (<code>/</code>) on integers and
              strings. There are dozens of practical applications of this, mathematical operations being just
              the
              beginning.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">1 + 1; // returns 2
2 * 2; // returns 4
2 - 2; // returns 0
2 / 2; // returns 1
const num1 = 2
const num2 = 2
num1 + num2 // returns 4
const string1 = &apos;My name is&apos;
const string2 = &apos;Bob&apos;
string1 + string2 // returns &apos;My name is Bob&apos;</code></pre>
            <h3 id="">%</h3>
            <p>Something you may not have seen before is the <em>modulo operator</em> (%). This math operator
              will
              divide two numbers (integers or floats) and return only the remainder. For example, <code>10 /
                3</code> is 3 with a remainder of 1, so <code>10 % 3</code> (read as &apos;10 mod 3&apos;) will
              return <code>1</code> .</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">21 % 5; // returns 1
21 % 6; // returns 3
21 % 7; // returns 0</code></pre>
            <h3 id="mathpow">Math.pow</h3>
            <p>We can use the <code>pow</code> method on <code>Math</code> to return a number raised to an
              exponent. It will take two numbers. The first is the base and the second is the power. For
              example,
              <code>Math.pow(5,2)</code> calculates 5 squared, which is 25. See some more examples below:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">Math.pow(2,2) // returns 4
Math.pow(3,2) // returns 9
Math.pow(3,3) // returns 27</code></pre>
            <h3 id="mathround-mathfloor-mathceil">Math.round, Math.floor, Math.ceil</h3>
            <p><code>Math</code> also has methods that will round numbers for us. <code>.round</code> will round
              a
              number to the nearest whole number. <code>.floor</code> will always round a number down to the
              nearest whole number. <code>.ceil</code> will always round up to the nearest whole number.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">Math.round(6.5) // returns 7
Math.round(6.45) // returns 6
Math.floor(6.999) // returns 6
Math.ceil(6.0001) // returns 7</code></pre>
            <h3 id="truthiness">Truthiness</h3>
            <p>In these lessons, we have talked a lot about the Boolean values, <code>true</code> and
              <code>false</code>. When using an <code>if</code> statement or other statements that expect a
              Boolean value (such as the <code>!</code>, NOT), if the expression given is not a Boolean value,
              JavaScript will do something called type coercion and transform whatever it is given into a
              Boolean
              value. This is known as &quot;truthy&quot; and &quot;falsey&quot; - yes, seriously. Every data
              type
              has some truthiness to it. Here are some examples:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">// items that are interpreted as true
true
1
&apos; &apos;
[] // an array, you&apos;ll learn more about this later
{} // an object, you&apos;ll learn more about this later
function() {}
// items that are interpreted as false
false
0
undefined
null
&apos;&apos;</code></pre>
            <h3 id="comparison-operators">Comparison Operators</h3>
            <p>JavaScript has a number of comparison and logical operators, (<code>&gt;</code>
              <code>&gt;=</code>
              <code>&lt;</code> <code>&lt;=</code> <code>===</code> <code>!==</code>). These operators work just
              as they would in math: greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and all the rest. We use
              these operators to evaluate two expressions. As the computer runs the code, the operator will
              return
              either a <code>true</code> (if the statement is true) or a <code>false</code> (if the statement is
              not true).
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">1 &gt; 2;     // false
2 &lt; 3;     // true
10 &gt;= 10;  // true
100 &lt;= 1;  // false</code></pre>
            <p>The &quot;triple equals&quot; sign ( <code>===</code> ) must not be confused with a single equal
              sign (which indicates assigning a value to a variable). The triple equal will compare everything
              about the two items, including type, and return if they are exactly equal or not.<br>
              (Something to note: there is also a &quot;double equals&quot; ( <code>==</code> ) sign which will
              compare two items, but it allows type coercion so a string and an integer can be considered equal
              (<code>1 == &apos;1&apos; // true</code>). Due to this, it is considered bad practice to use the
              double equal sign. We would like to see you always using the triple equal sign, and you will
              always
              see us using it.)</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">1 === 1;          // true
1 === &apos;1&apos;;        // false
&apos;cat&apos; === &apos;cat&apos;;  // true
&apos;cat&apos; === &apos;Cat&apos;;  // false</code></pre>
            <p>The last comparison operator we would like to introduce you to has two parts to it.</p>
            <p>First is the &quot;NOT&quot; (<code>!</code>). When you see this it will mean that we are asking
              the opposite of the expression (we will revisit the NOT operator later in this lesson).</p>
            <p>With that in mind, we can introduce the &quot;not equals&quot; ( <code>!==</code> ) sign. This
              will
              return true if the items are NOT equal to each other, in any way. This, like the triple equal
              sign,
              takes type into account.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">1 !== 1;          // false
1 !== &apos;1&apos;;        // true
&apos;cat&apos; !== &apos;cat&apos;;  // false
&apos;cat&apos; !== &apos;Cat&apos;;  // true</code></pre>
            <h3 id="logical-operators">Logical Operators</h3>
            <p>We can also combine two equality expressions and ask if either of them are true, both of them are
              true, or neither of them is true. To do this we will use Logical Operators.</p>
            <h4 id="-1"><code>&amp;&amp;</code></h4>
            <p>The first logical operator we will look at is the &quot;AND&quot; operator. It is written with
              two
              ampersands (&amp;&amp;). This will evaluate both expressions and will return true if BOTH
              expressions are true. If one (or both) of them is false, then this operator will return false.<br>
              For example, <code>(100 &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; 10 === 10)</code> will return true because both
              statements are true, but <code>(10 === 9 &amp;&amp; 10 &gt; 9)</code> will return false because
              one
              statement is false.</p>
            <h4 id="-2"><code>||</code></h4>
            <p>Next up is the &quot;OR&quot; operator. It is written with two vertical bars (||). This operator
              will check two expressions and return true if either one is true. It will return false only if
              BOTH
              expressions are false. As you&apos;d expect a line where both parts are true would return true.
              Like
              so:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">(100 &gt; 10 || 10 === 10) //true</code></pre>
            <p>Similarly this line where only one expression is accurate, would return true. Like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">(10 === 9 || 10 &gt; 9) //true</code></pre>
            <p>If both expressions are false, like this, then the result will be false.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">(10 === 9 || 1 &gt; 9) //false</code></pre>
            <h4 id="-3"><code>!</code></h4>
            <p>The last logical operator is the &quot;NOT&quot; operator. It is written as a single exclamation
              mark (<code>!</code>). We saw this operator earlier when determining equality (<code>!==</code>).
              As
              before, the NOT operator will return the opposite Boolean value of what is passed to it.</p>
            <p>In this first case, since the opposite of false is true, <code>(!false)</code> would return true.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">(!false) // true</code></pre>
            <p>Similarly since 1 is equal to 1 and this statement is true, <code>!(1===1)</code> would return
              false thanks to the <code>!</code> operator.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">(!(1 === 1)) // false</code></pre>
            <h4 id="notes-about-logical-operators">Notes About Logical Operators</h4>
            <p>A couple things to note about logical operators.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The expressions are evaluated in order, and the computer will skip any redundant expressions.
                  In an <code>&amp;&amp;</code> statement, if the first expression is <code>false</code>, the
                  second expression will not be evaluated because BOTH expressions need to be <code>true</code>.
                  Same for the <code>||</code> statement. If the first expression is <code>true</code>, the
                  second
                  will not be evaluated because there only needs to be one <code>true</code> statement to
                  fulfill
                  the requirements of the operator.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Use parentheses. As we saw in the second <code>!</code> operator example, we used parentheses
                  to evaluate what was inside of the parentheses FIRST, then applied the <code>!</code>
                  operator.
                  We can wrap ANY expression in parentheses and it will be evaluated before evaluating the
                  expression as a whole.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You may have tried the following riddle on your friend as a kid. Using our knowledge of variables
              and math we&apos;re going to create a console application to return a person&apos;s birthday
              starting with just the number <code>7</code>. The steps we need to take are as follows.</p>
            <pre><code class="text language-text">Enter the number 7
Multiply by the month of your birth
Subtract 1
Multiply by 13
Add the day of your birth

            <p>We&apos;ll walk through the example for someone born on February 22. First, we need to create our
              magical number variable. We&apos;ll use <code>let</code> so that this can be easily changed.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">let magicalNumber = 7;</code></pre>
            <p>Now, we test the riddle. For every calculation we will need to change the value of
              <code>magicalNumber</code> and preform the riddle step.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">// Multiply by the month of your birth
magicalNumber = magicalNumber * 2
// Subtract 1
magicalNumber = magicalNumber - 1
// Multiply by 13
magicalNumber = magicalNumber * 13
// Add the day of your birth
magicalNumber = magicalNumber + 22
// Add 3
magicalNumber = magicalNumber + 3
// Multiply by 11
magicalNumber = magicalNumber * 11
// Subtract the month of your birth
magicalNumber = magicalNumber - 2
// Subtract the day of your birth
magicalNumber = magicalNumber - 22
// Divide by 10
magicalNumber = magicalNumber / 10
// Add 11
magicalNumber = magicalNumber + 11
// Divide by 100
magicalNumber = magicalNumber / 100</code></pre>
            <p>Finally, let&apos;s <code>console.log</code> our magical number and see if it returns
              <code>2.22</code> as expected. If our calculations are correct, this should work for any birthday!
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">console.log(magicalNumber)</code></pre>
            <p>To make this application more useful, you could create a variable called <code>birthMonth</code>
              and another called <code>birthYear</code> and let the program run on its on.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <h3 id="control-flow">Control Flow</h3>
            <p>Often times, as a computer is reading and executing our code, we want code to run only if
              something
              is true or not. For example, add one point to the variable <code>score</code> <strong>if</strong>
              the character touches a coin. This is known as control flow or conditional logic. Control flow
              means
              that not all code on the screen is executed in order, or at all. We will learn to use some basic
              control flow today, and will dive deeper into it in our next lesson.</p>
            <p>Let&apos;s say you wanted to write a simple script to check whether someone is a legal driver.
              You
              could use conditional logic to print a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> boolean.</p>
            <iframe data-src="https://repl.it/@sunjieming/Conditionals?lite=true" height="400px" width="100%"
              scrolling="yes" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"
              sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <p>Here we are taking a number (age) and checking to see if the statement is true. The statement 16
              &gt; 15 is true, so our code will return <code>true</code>. If it is not, it will skip that chunk
              of
              code and return <code>false</code>.</p>
            <p><strong>Check For Understanding:</strong> Change the value of <code>age</code> above so that the
              code will return <code>false</code>.</p>
            <p>We just learned about the <code>if</code> operator. We can use <code>if</code> to check and see
              <strong>if</strong> an expression is true. If it is, JavaScript will run some code. If it is not,
              JavaScript will skip the code and keep running the program.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">if (1 + 1 === 2) {
    console.log(&apos;The expression is true!&apos;);
}
// since 1 + 1 does equal 2, JavaScript will console.log (&quot;The expression is true!&quot;)
if (1 + 1 === 3) {
    console.log(&apos;The expression is true!&apos;);
}
// since 1 + 1 does NOT equal 2, JavaScript will NOT console.log (&quot;The expression is true!&quot;)</code></pre>
            <p>To add on to <code>if</code>, we can also use the <code>else</code> and <code>else if</code>
              statements. These statements must be used only after <code>if</code> has been used. These
              statements
              will be evaluated <strong>if</strong> the initial <code>if</code> returns false. We can think of
              the
              <code>else if</code> as another <code>if</code> statement that has been chained (we can have as
              many
              else if statements we want). Only one <code>if</code> or <code>else if</code> statement code block
              will be run. If at any time a statement evaluates to true, that code will be run and the rest will
              be skipped:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">if (1 + 1 === 3) {
    console.log(&apos;This will be skipped!&apos;); // since 1 + 1 is NOT 3, this will be skipped
} else if (1 + 1 === 2) {
    console.log(&apos;This code will be run.&apos;); // since 1 + 1 is equal to 2, this will be run
} else if (1 - 1 === 0) {
    // 1 - 1 IS 0, however, the previous if statement was already true, so this will be skipped
    console.log(&apos;This code will NOT be run.&apos;);
}</code></pre>
            <p>The else statement will always come at the end of an if-else if chain, and will act as a default.
              If <em>none</em> of the expressions returned true, the else code block will be run no matter what.
              If any of the previous if or else if expressions are true, the else statement code block will not
              be
              run.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">if (1 + 1 === 3) {
    console.log(&apos;This will be skipped!&apos;); // since 1 + 1 is NOT 3, this will be skipped
} else if (1 + 1 === 3) {
    console.log(&apos;This code will NOT be run&apos;); // since 1 + 1 is NOT 3, this will be skipped
} else {
    console.log(&apos;This code will be run&apos;); // since the above were skipped, this will run
}</code></pre>
            <h4 id="why-use-else-if">Why use else-if?</h4>
            <p>You may be thinking to yourself, &quot;Why not just use a bunch of different if statements? Why
              use
              else-if? That is a valid question, and sometimes that is the right approach to take. It is up to
              you
              to decide which is the right approach. Remember, when using a block of conditionals, only ONE of
              the
              statements will be run, even if there are multiple statements that are true. The same can not be
              said for multiple if statements; they will run if true regardless of statements before and after.
              Take this example:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const age = 21;
if(age &gt; 20) {
    console.log(&apos;older than 20!&apos;);
} else if (age &gt; 15){
    console.log(&apos;older than 15!&apos;);
} else {
    console.log(&apos;younger than 15!&apos;);
}</code></pre>
            <p>In the above example only <code>older than 20!</code> will be logged even though both the if
              statement and else if statement were true.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const age = 21;
if(age &gt; 20) {
    console.log(&apos;older than 20!&apos;);
}
if (age &gt; 15) {
    console.log(&apos;older than 15!&apos;);
}
if (age &lt;= 15) {
    console.log(&apos;younger than 15!&apos;);
}</code></pre>
            <p>In the above example the first and second if statements would be logged because both of them are
              true.</p>
            <p>As you can see, it will be up to you to decide if you want to have multiple actions based on your
              data or just one action.</p>
            <h2 id="follow-along">Follow Along</h2>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> the following example will span several lessons, we suggest forking the
              repl.it below and saving your work as you go along. As always, you can also code along in the
              repl.it here.</p>

              sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <p>Let&apos;s create an algorithm to flip a coin and <code>console.log()</code> &quot;heads&quot; or
              &quot;tails.&quot; To do this, we&apos;ll generate a random <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> and
              write a conditional <code>if</code> statement to return the <code>heads</code> or
              <code>tails</code>
              reading.
            </p>
            <p>First lets set up a variable called <code>coinFlip</code> and give it a randomly assigned
              <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> value. To do this we need to use two methods of the
              <code>Math</code> object - <code>Math.round()</code> and <code>Math.random()</code>.
              <code>Math.random()</code> generates a random number between 0 and 1, and
              <code>Math.round()</code>
              rounds that decimal to the nearest whole number.
            </p>
            <p>In the syntax below, Javascript <em>first</em> reads <code>Math.random()</code> and generates a
              random number, for example, 0.56324. Then it reads <code>Math.round()</code> and applies it to the
              random number, giving an integer, in this example, a <code>1</code>.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">var coinFlip = Math.round(Math.random());</code></pre>
            <p>Add this to your repl.it and console.log() <code>coinFlip</code> a few times to make sure
              you&apos;re getting a mix of <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s.</p>
            <p>Next up, we&apos;ll add our conditional logic. Since we already have a randomly generated 0 or 1,
              we can set up an <strong>if/else</strong> statement where <code>1</code> represents
              <code>&quot;Heads&quot;</code> and <code>0</code> represents <code>&quot;Tails&quot;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>We&apos;ll write this statement using the syntax we learned above, such that <strong>if</strong>
              <code>coinFlip</code> is equal to <code>1</code>, we will console.log
              <code>&quot;Heads&quot;</code>. Otherwise (<strong>else</strong>), we can assume
              <code>coinFlip</code> must be <code>0</code> and console.log <code>&quot;Tails&quot;</code>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">if (coinFlip === 1){
    console.log(&quot;Heads&quot;)
} else{
    console.log(&quot;Tails&quot;)
}</code></pre>
            <p>We now have a fully functional coin flipping algorithm! Congratulations. You can view and run the
              solution code in the pen below. We&apos;ll continue to add to this over the next few objectives.

            <h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
            <p>Most software runs on loops, evaluating expressions over and over again until it either returns
              what we are looking for, or hits a certain number of loops. JavaScript has two looping expressions
              built into it and today we will look at the first one, the &quot;for&quot; loop.</p>
            <h3 id="for-loops">For Loops</h3>
            <p>Imagine you wanted to console.log() the phrase <code>hello, world!</code> 5 times. With your
              current knowledge that would look something like this. This is just for illustration, please,
              never
              code like this.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">console.log(&quot;hello, world!&quot;);

            <p>In general, you should almost <strong>never</strong> have to copy and paste chunks of code. Not
              only is it a bad programming practice, it is time consuming, and it leads to errors. Consider, for
              example, how much work it would be if you wanted to change &quot;world&quot; to someone&apos;s
              name.
              So how would you console.log() <code>hello, world!</code> five times? Using <code>for</code>
              loops!
              With a <code>for</code> loop, the above example could be reduced to the following.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
// | declare a var | conditional expression | increment var|
    console.log(&quot;hello, world!&quot;);
}</code></pre>
            <p><code>for</code> loops are useful anytime you need to run the same block of code a certain number
              of times. Imagine you go to the store and want to buy 10 avocados. Instead of scanning each
              avocado
              one by one, the cashier will add the cost of one avocado to your total <strong>for</strong> each
              avocado you buy. In other words, <strong>for</strong> each avocado, add <code>cost</code>. This
              would result in adding <code>cost</code> 10 times.</p>
            <p><code>for</code> loops have a unique syntax, similar to the <code>if</code> statement, but
              slightly
              more complex. First, we have the <code>for</code> keyword, followed by parentheses, and then open
              and close braces. Within the parentheses, we will need three things. First, we must declare a
              variable (usually <code>i</code>) as a starting point. Then, we will have a conditional
              expression.
              The loop will continue happening until this statement is <code>false</code>. Third, we will
              increment our variable, telling the loop a pattern to follow. Usually, the increment will be
              <code>i++</code>, meaning increase <code>i</code> by 1 every time the loop runs. All three of
              these
              statements are separated by a semicolon.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">for (let i = 0      ; i &lt; 10                 ; i++          ) {
//  | declare a var | conditional expression | increment var|
     console.log(i);
}</code></pre>
            <p>In this example, we see that we initially set our <code>counter</code> variable (<code>i</code>)
              to
              0. The loop will run and each time it gets to the end, it will increase the counter by one. The
              for
              loop will then evaluate the conditional expression. If it is <code>true</code>, it will run again,
              but if it is <code>false</code> it will stop running. Therefore, the return of the example above
              would be the following:</p>

            <p><strong>Check For Understanding:</strong> Edit the code above to return 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
              (each
              on a new line is fine).</p>
            <h3 id="the--operator">The ++ operator</h3>
            <p>We saw in the last two examples the <code>++</code> operator. This is JavaScript shorthand for
              &quot;Set the value of the variable to its current value plus one&quot;. There are a few more of
              these variable math/assignment shorthand expressions. We will visit them in upcoming lessons.</p>
            <h3 id="while-loops">While loops</h3>
            <p>While loops are similar to for loops in that they make it easy to repeat some action for a
              desired
              amount of time. Just like for loops, they will run so long as a condition is met. The key
              difference
              here is that you don&apos;t need to declare an incrementing variable when you declare a while
              loop.
            </p>
            <p>Syntactically, while loops look like this. Note that the example below is what we call an
              &quot;infinite loop&quot; because the condition will never be false.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">while (i === true) {
  console.log(&quot;i is true&quot;);
}</code></pre>
            <p>Most practical example of loops will use some kind of &quot;counter&quot;, an outside variable
              that
              will be affected by what&apos;s inside the loop. A more practical example of a while loop, using a
              counter, might look like:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">let count = 1;
while (count &lt; 10) {
    console.log(count);
    count +=2;
}</code></pre>
            <p>The return of this loop would be 11 because the loop would add 2 every time it runs, until the
              value is greater than 10.</p>
            <h3 id="infinite-loops">Infinite Loops</h3>
            <p>As mentioned, it is possible to write a loop such that it never ends. This is what we call an
              &quot;Infinite Loop&quot; and it will break your program. Take for example this loop:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">for (let i = 0; i &gt;= 0; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}</code></pre>
            <p>Because our conditional expression will ALWAYS be <code>true</code> (<code>i</code> will never be
              less than 0) this loop will essentially run forever. This will break your program, and may crash
              your web browser, or computer.</p>
            <h2 id="follow-along">Follow Along</h2>
            <p>Let&apos;s wrap our heads/tails program in a loop to allow a user to play more than one time.</p>
            <p>We&apos;ll start where we left off with the conditional. Its actually fairly simple to add loop
              functionality. We&apos;re going to wrap this whole chunk of code inside a for loop.</p>
            <iframe data-src="https://repl.it/@sunjieming/coinFlip-II?lite=true" height="400px" width="100%"
              scrolling="yes" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"
              sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <p>To do so we&apos;ll utilize the same syntax from above, and for now we&apos;ll tell the loop to
              run
              five times. We&apos;ll start by declaring the <code>for</code> keyword, then setting our initial
              value to <code>0</code> (<code>let i = 0</code>). We want the loop to run until <code>i</code> is
              equal to <code>5</code>, <code>i &lt; 5</code>, and to add <code>1</code> to <code>i</code> every
              time the loop runs.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">for (let i = 0;         i &lt; 5;          i++) {
//   start at 0   | loop until 5   | add one every time</code></pre>
            <p>As you might imagine, we can now change the number of coinFlips to preform by changing the
              conditional expression above, so <code>i &lt; 5</code> could change to <code>i &lt; 10</code> and
              our coin would be flipped 10 times.</p>
            <p>Its important to note that the variable needs to go inside of the loop so that it is randomly
              generated each time the loop runs. Otherwise, <code>coinFlip</code> would be declared outside of
              the
              loop and our end result would be 5 <code>heads</code> or 5 <code>tails</code>. Go ahead and try
              moving the variable around to see what we mean.</p>
            <p>With this seemingly simple MVP, you could go on to add a lot of functionality to this program,
              including user interaction through <code>window.prompt()</code> or by integrating HTML. Again, you
              can view and run the solution code in the pen below.</p>

            <h3 id="introduction-to-functions">Introduction to Functions</h3>
            <p>Functions allow you, the developer, to repeat sections of code with just a single line. Consider,
              for a second, you want to &quot;program&quot; a robot to bake you cookies. A practical program,
              because you&apos;d have cookies all the time! Code, without functions, might include steps like
              <code>addFlour</code>, <code>addEggs</code>, <code>addChocolateChips</code>,
              <code>preheatOven</code>, <code>bake</code>. A function could collect these steps into a container
              called <code>bakeCookies()</code>. Then, running <code>bakeCookies()</code> would produce the
              same,
              delicious result as the individual steps.
            </p>
            <p>We mentioned earlier that you never want to copy and paste code, this is not only true when you
              want to repeat one single action, but also when you want to repeat a whole chunk of actions. In
              the
              case of the latter, we use functions.</p>
            <p>We can think of functions as small computer programs. Functions allow us to write code that will
              be
              used over and over again, keeping our code <code>DRY</code> (&quot;<strong>D</strong>on&apos;t
              <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself!&quot;).
            </p>
            <p>Before we dive into syntax, study the following example and predict the output.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function myFunc() {
    console.log(&apos;this is my function!&apos;)
}
myFunc()</code></pre>
            <p>If you guessed that the output would be <code>this is my function</code>, congratulations - you
              are
              correct! Once you&apos;ve declared a function, like <code>myFunc</code> it can be used over and
              over
              again to give the same, predictable result.</p>
            <iframe data-src="https://repl.it/@sunjieming/Functions?lite=true" height="400px" width="100%"
              scrolling="yes" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"
              sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Check For Understanding:</strong> Edit the code above to <code>console.log()</code>
              &quot;Hello, World!&quot; when <code>myFunc()</code> is called.</p>
            <h3 id="function-syntax">Function Syntax</h3>
            <p>Just like we used <code>const</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>var</code> to declare
              variables,
              we use the keyword <code>function</code> to declare functions.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function myFunc() {
// tasks go here
}</code></pre>
            <p>The <code>function</code> keyword tells whatever is running your program that what follows is a
              function and to treat it as such. After that comes the name - we like to give functions names that
              describe what they do, like <code>logsHello</code>. Then comes an open and a close parentheses,
              <code>()</code>. And finally, open and close brackets. In between these brackets is where all of
              our
              function code will go.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function logsHello() {
    console.log(&apos;hello&apos;);
}
logsHello();</code></pre>
            <p>In this example, we declare a function <code>logsHello</code> and set it up to
              <code>console.log</code> <code>&apos;hello&apos;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>In order to run this function, we need to write or invoke its name with the parentheses after it,
              <code>logsHello()</code>. This is the syntax to run (aka. call) a function. A function always
              needs
              parentheses to run.
            </p>
            <iframe data-src="https://repl.it/@sunjieming/Functions-2?lite=true" height="400px" width="100%"
              scrolling="yes" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"
              sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Check For Understanding:</strong> The function syntax above is correct, but nothing shows
              up when the program is run! Add a line of code so that the console displays <code>hello</code>.
            </p>
            <h4 id="function-declaration-hoisting">Function Declaration Hoisting</h4>
            <p>JavaScript utilizes a two-pass compiler when executing lines of code that we write. This means
              that
              anytime we run JavaScript in the browser, the browser will take two passes over our code. The
              first
              pass builds up references to all of our code, declaring variables and functions and the like. The
              second pass applies values to the references that were found, thus actually running the code.</p>
            <p>Function declarations are defined in the first pass. The compiler is made aware of the function
              declaration and adds it to the top of the execution order for your code. This concept of putting a
              function higher in the execution order for later use is known as hoisting.</p>
            <p>What does this mean for you? It means that function declarations can be invoked <em>before</em>
              they are defined! Let&apos;s take a look at an example:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">// This code is valid above the definition!
console.log(add(2,4)) // 6
function add(a,b){
 console.log(a + b);
}</code></pre>
            <p>This is odd behavior to developers new to JavaScript. It can be used as a feature or introduce
              bugs
              if not understood properly. Be aware that hoisting applies to function declarations and not
              function
              expressions or arrow functions.</p>
            <h3 id="function-expressions">Function Expressions</h3>
            <p>Now that we have a better understanding of how basic function syntax works, we can push even
              further into another type of function, a function expression.</p>
            <p>Function expressions have unique differences when compared against function declarations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A variable is used to store the function for later use</li>
              <li>Anonymous functions are used</li>
              <li>Function expressions are not hoisted. They can only be invoked after a definition has been
                placed in the execution stack.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example of a function expression:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const add = function(a,b){
 console.log(a + b);
}
add(2,4) // 6</code></pre>
            <p>Notice the function doesn&apos;t actually have a name. This is what we refer to as an
              <em>anonymous
                function</em>. Because we are using a <code>const</code> named <code>add</code> we don&apos;t
              need
              to name our function anything. We can simply execute the function when <code>add</code> is
              referenced by invocation.
            </p>
            <p>Why do this and not use a function declaration? Because we have more control over our code now.
              We
              will discuss this in greater detail later on with scope and closure. For now, just know that arrow
              functions make code more concise.</p>
            <h3 id="arrow-function-expressions">Arrow Function Expressions</h3>
            <p>Arrow functions are fancy looking function expressions with a major feature removed, the
              <code>function</code> keyword. We won&apos;t focus on why this is important right now, Instead, we
              will start getting used to seeing the syntax of what an arrow function looks like:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">// function expression syntax
// const add = function(a,b) {
//  console.log a + b;
// }
// arrow function expression syntax
const add = (a,b) =&gt; {
 console.log(a + b);
}
add(2,4) // 6</code></pre>
            <p>You will notice that we removed the <code>function</code> keyword in front of our parameters and
              then added a <code>=&gt;</code> token behind the parameters. This is a pretty straightforward
              conversion!</p>
            <p>Syntactically, we didn&apos;t remove much, we lost a few characters in the word
              <code>function</code> and gained a <code>=&gt;</code>. However, there are many sub-rules for
              syntax
              with arrow functions. Those sub-rules can create extremely streamlined syntax. This line of code
              is
              a good example.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">// streamlined arrow syntax
const add = (a,b) =&gt; console.log(a + b);
add(2,4); // 6</code></pre>
            <p>Wow, there are a lot of abstractions occurring there! We do not need our <code>{}</code> because
              they are redundant in the rules of arrow functions. You haven&apos;t seen <code>return</code>
              statements yet, but they too, are not needed in arrow functions.</p>
            <p>It&apos;s fun to see how slim we can get, but a word of caution: stick with the simple conversion
              first and slowly step into using other syntactical sugar approaches as you progress.</p>
            <p>Often, developers will go too far with syntactical sugar, and the code becomes very hard to read.
              Arrow function expressions are great to use with array methods, for example, but may not be a
              great
              choice in a lot of other places.</p>
            <h4 id="when-not-to-use-arrow-functions">When Not To Use Arrow Functions</h4>
            <p>There is a time and place for arrow functions. Here is a list of times you should not be using
              them:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Event handlers (Unless they are inside a class constructor!)</li>
              <li>Object methods</li>
              <li>Prototype methods</li>
              <li>Anytime you need to use arguments Object</li>

            <p>Just like with loops, all we need to do is add another layer of functionality here, so we&apos;ll
              wrap a function declaration around all the code we already have.</p>
            <p>We need to declare the function with the keyword <code>function</code>, then name it with
              <code>name</code> + <code>()</code>, so here we can write <code>function name()</code> and wrap
              the
              whole function in curly brackets (<code>{}</code>) like so.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function flip() {
    // coin flip algorithm goes here
}</code></pre>
            <p>When this process is successfully completed, a single line of code (<code>flip()</code>) will run
              our coin flip game! As usual, view and run solution code below.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <h3 id="passing-data-into-functions">Passing Data into Functions</h3>
            <p>Let&apos;s return to our cookie example. Pretend that you want your robot to bake different
              <em>types</em> of cookies. Do you need to write a new function for every cookie? Not at all.
              Instead, you could add a parameter, or variable, called <code>recipe</code> and call
              <code>bakeCookies(&apos;pecan&apos;)</code> or
              <code>bakeCookies(&apos;chocolateChunk&apos;)</code>.
            </p>
            <p>Parameters are how functions accept changing data. Consider the example below.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function add(num1, num2) {
  return (num1 + num2);
}
add(2,2) // returns 4
add(4,5) // returns 9</code></pre>
            <p>We can declare variables called <code>parameters</code> (num1 and num2 in the example above) that
              represent data we will use when calling the function. This is similar to algebra. <code>X + Y =
                Z</code> would be a pretty meaningless equation, but once we substitute <em>real numbers</em>
              for
              <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, we can easily solve for <code>Z</code>. Here, <code>X</code>
              and
              <code>Y</code> are analogous to parameters, and the <em>real numbers</em> to
              <code>arguments</code>.
            </p>
            <p>We&apos;ll dive into details about both parameters and arguments in this section, but the
              differences can be summarized as follows.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Function parameters are the names listed in the function&apos;s definition.</li>
              <li>Function arguments are the real values passed to the function.</li>
              <li>Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="parameters">Parameters</h4>
            <p>As illustrated above, a function parameter will represent the data we pass into a function, for
              use
              in the function. Essentially when we write a function we assign the data variable names, even
              without knowing what the data will be. We set these <code>variables</code> inside of the
              parentheses
              when we write the function. There is no limit to the amount of parameters we can include in a
              function, but each variable name must be separated by a comma. We can then use these
              <code>variables</code> within our function just as we would any other variable.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function myFunc( parameter1, parameter2) {
    // We can use parameter1 and parameter2 in this function just like a variable
}</code></pre>
            <h4 id="arguments">Arguments</h4>
            <p>Once we have our parameters set up in our function, we can now pass data into the function. In
              order to do this, we will put each piece of data inside the the parentheses we write when we call
              the function. We call these pieces of data <code>arguments</code>. <code>arguments</code> can be
              ANY
              data type (string, number, Boolean, object, array, even other functions!). Unlike other languages,
              JavaScript does not require us to set the data type when we write the function, although you
              should
              make an effort to understand what type of data will be coming into the function (and if you are
              using pre-built functions, you should know what data type that function expects).</p>
            <p>To use an argument, just put the data in the function call parentheses like so:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function logsName(name){
    console.log(name);
}
logsName(&apos;Dan&apos;); // returns Dan
logsName(&apos;Diandra&apos;); // returns Diandra</code></pre>
            <p>If you have more than one parameter, you will use more than one argument:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function logsSchool( School, descriptor ){
    console.log(`${School} ${descriptor}`);
}
logsSchool(&apos;Lambda&apos;, &apos;is Awesome!&apos;); // logs Lambda is Awesome!</code></pre>
            <p>Arguments will always line up with parameters in order, so the first argument will be the first
              parameter, and so on.</p>
            <p>If an argument is not given for a parameter, the parameter will be equal to
              <code>undefined</code>.
            </p>

              width="100%" scrolling="yes" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"
              sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Check For Understanding:</strong> Call <code>logsPerson</code> to return a greeting with
              your name, city, and favorite color <em>without</em> changing the function itself.</p>
            <h4 id="the-return-statement">The <code>return</code> Statement</h4>
            <p>We will not always want to <code>console.log()</code> everything that comes out of a function.
              Most
              likely we will want to return something for use in other operations. The only way for us to use
              data
              that is local to a function is with the keyword <code>return</code>. <code>return</code>,
              essentially, lets data escape a function. Nothing other than what is returned can be accessed
              outside of the function. <code>return</code> is always the last thing in a function because when
              the
              function hits a return statement, the function immediately stops everything else that it is doing.
            </p>
            <p>We can also assign the value of a return statement to another variable, and we will now have
              access
              to the data returned from the function.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function addTwoNumbers(num1, num2) {
   const sum = num1 + num2;
   return sum;
   console.log(&apos;This will never be reached&apos;);
}
const newSum = addTwoNumbers( 1, 2 );
console.log(addTwoNumbers(1,2)); //returns 3
console.log(sum); // returns undefined - sum exists only inside the function
console.log(newSum); // returns 3 - value is held in newSum</code></pre>
            <ul>
              <li>Note: We will never be able to have access to the actual variable created in the function. We
                will only have access to the data that variable was assigned to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="follow-along">Follow Along</h2>
            <p>When we left our coin flip game, it flipped the coin 5 times, according to the conditional
              expression in our <code>for</code> loop.</p>
            <iframe data-src="https://repl.it/@sunjieming/coinFlip-IV?lite=true" height="400px" width="100%"
              scrolling="yes" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"
              sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <p>To allow our users to flip the coin a variable number of times we can use a parameter,
              <code>repeat</code>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function flip(repeat){
    // add parameter
}</code></pre>
            <p>We will reference <code>repeat</code> into our conditional expression which will cause the loop
              to
              run a variable number of times.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function flip(repeat) {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; repeat; i++) {
      // use parameter as conditional expression
  }
}</code></pre>
            <p>When we run the function, we&apos;ll substitute the variable <code>repeat</code> for a number.
              For
              example, substituting <code>repeat</code> for 10, would flip the coin 10 times.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">flip(10); // &lt;- will flip coin 10 times</code></pre>
            <p>Our final product will look something like this. Play around with the <code>repeat</code>
              argument
              here until you can clearly explain how the argument changes the functions output.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>In the first JavaScript lesson, we discussed the 3 basic data types (strings, numbers, and
              Booleans), and how to assign those data types to variables. We discussed how a variable can only
              point to a single string, number, or Boolean. In many cases, though, we want to be able to point
              to
              a collection of data of either the same or different types. For example, what if we wanted to keep
              track of cookie flavors using a single variable, <code>flavors</code>. We can do that using
              Arrays.
              We can think of arrays as storage containers for collections of data. Building an array is simple:
              declare a variable and set it to []. We can then add however many strings, numbers, or Booleans we
              want to the container (comma separated), and access those items whenever we want.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];</code></pre>
            <h4 id="length">.length</h4>
            <p>Just like the String data type which has a built-in <code>.length</code> property, the array also
              has a built-in <code>.length</code> property. In fact, the array has a lot of useful built-in
              methods (we will be discussing those in later lessons). Just as string <code>.length</code> counts
              the characters, array <code>.length</code> will return the number of items in an array:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];
    console.log(flavors.length);  // 4</code></pre>
            <h3 id="accessing-items-in-an-array">Accessing Items in an Array</h3>
            <p>We can access an item at any time in an array, we just need to call the item by its position in
              the
              array. Items are given a numerical position (index) according to where it is in the array, in
              order.
              An array&apos;s numerical order ALWAYS starts at 0, so the first item is in the 0 index, the
              second
              in the 1 index, the third in the 2, and so on (this can be tricky at first, but just remember
              <strong>arrays always start at 0</strong>).
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];
                           0               1            2               3</code></pre>
            <p>In order to access the item, we will type the name or the array variable, followed by brackets
              containing the numerical assignment.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];
    console.log(flavors[1]);  // &apos;sugar&apos;</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Check For Understanding:</strong> console.log &apos;Brandon&apos; by accessing it from
              the
              array.</p>
            <p>Without knowing an array&apos;s length, it&apos;s still possible to access the last item using
              some
              simple logic. The return of the length property <code>- 1</code> will always return the last item
              in
              the array. We know the first item is always going to be 0, and every item after is shifted over
              one
              number. So in our example, the last item has an index of 3 even though <code>flavors</code> has a
              length of 4. Therefore when we don&apos;t know the number of items in an array we can access the
              last item like so:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];
    console.log(flavors[flavors.length - 1]);  // &apos;lemon crisp&apos;</code></pre>
            <h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
            <p>We can assign and reassign any index in the array using the bracket/index and an <code>=</code>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];
    flavors[0] = &apos;caramel pecan&apos;;
    console.log(flavors);  // [&apos;caramel pecan&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;]</code></pre>

            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const fortunes = [&quot;yes, definitely&quot;, &quot;you can rely on it.&quot;, &quot;Without a doubt.&quot;, &quot;most likely.&quot;, &quot;hmm... I&apos;m not sure!&quot;, &quot;yikes. Nope.&quot;, &quot;try again.&quot;, &quot;very doubtful.&quot;]</code></pre>
            <p>We can access individual fortunes using their index like fortunes[0] or fortunes[1] to access
              &quot;yes, definitely&quot; and &quot;you can rely on it,&quot; respectively.</p>
            <p>Since we already have a random number generator built into our code in the form of
              <code>answer</code>. We can replace all of the conditionals with a single line,
              <code>console.log(fortune[answer]);</code>, condensing almost 20 lines into 1!
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function eightBall() {
    const answer = Math.floor(Math.random() * 8);
    const fortunes = [&quot;yes, definitely&quot;, &quot;you can rely on it.&quot;, &quot;Without a doubt.&quot;, &quot;most likely.&quot;, &quot;hmm... I&apos;m not sure!&quot;, &quot;yikes. Nope.&quot;, &quot;try again.&quot;, &quot;very doubtful.&quot;]
    fortune = fortunes[answer];
    console.log(fortune)
}
eightBall()</code></pre>
            <p>If we wanted to adjust our original code even further we could create a random number generator
              function. This code is easier to read and understand, but is similarly <code>DRY</code> compared
              to
              the above.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">function getRandomInt(min, max) {
  min = Math.ceil(min);
  max = Math.floor(max);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min; //The maximum is exclusive and the minimum is inclusive
}
function eightBall() {
    const fortunes = [&quot;yes, definitely&quot;, &quot;you can rely on it.&quot;, &quot;Without a doubt.&quot;, &quot;most likely.&quot;, &quot;hmm... I&apos;m not sure!&quot;, &quot;yikes. Nope.&quot;, &quot;try again.&quot;, &quot;very doubtful.&quot;];
    var fortune = fortunes[getRandomInt(0,7)];
}</code></pre>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>There will be times when you need to edit data inside of arrays, we have a few special
              <code>methods</code> in JavaScript to do so.
            </p>
            <h3 id="length">.length</h3>
            <p>Just like the String data type has a built in .length property, so does the array. In fact the
              array has a lot of useful built in methods (we will be discussing those in a moment and in later
              lessons). Just like the string .length counts the characters, array .length will return the number
              of items in an array:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];
console.log(flavors.length);  // 4</code></pre>
            <h3 id="push--pop">.push &amp; .pop</h3>
            <p>Two more very useful built-in array methods are <code>.push</code> and <code>.pop</code>. These
              methods refer to the adding and removing of items from the array after its initial declaration.
            </p>
            <p><code>.push</code> adds an item to the end of the array, incrementing its length by 1.
              (<code>.push</code> returns the new length)</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];
    flavors.push(&apos;carmel Pecan&apos;);
    console.log(flavors);  // [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;, `carmel pecan`]</code></pre>
            <p><code>.pop</code> removes the last item in the array, decrementing the length by 1.
              (<code>.pop</code> returns the &quot;popped&quot; item)</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];
    flavors.pop();
    console.log(flavors);  // [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;]</code></pre>
            <h3 id="unshift--shift">.unshift &amp; .shift</h3>
            <p><code>.unshift</code> and <code>.shift</code> are exactly like <code>.push</code> and
              <code>.pop</code>, except they operate on the first item in the array. <code>.unshift(item)</code>
              will put a new item in the first position of the array, and <code>.shift()</code> will remove the
              first item in the array.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const flavors = [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;];
    flavors.unshift(&apos;carmel pecan&apos;);
    console.log(flavors);  // [&apos;carmel pecan&apos;, &apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;]
    flavors.shift();
    console.log(flavors);  // [&apos;chocolate chip&apos;, &apos;sugar&apos;, &apos;peanut butter&apos;, &apos;lemon crisp&apos;]</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Check For Understanding:</strong> Use an array method to remove &apos;Jon&apos; from
              <code>studentNames</code>.
            </p>
            <h3 id="notes-on-arrays">Notes on Arrays</h3>
            <p>For those with prior programming experience: because JavaScript is not a strongly typed language,
              arrays do not need to be typed either. Arrays in JavaScript can contain multiple different data
              types in the same array.</p>
            <h2 id="follow-along">Follow Along</h2>
            <p>Recall our <code>eightBall</code> function from earlier. Use the space below to practice applying
              array methods to our <code>fortunes</code> array.</p>
            <iframe data-src="https://repl.it/@sunjieming/EightBall-II?lite=true" height="400px" width="100%"
              scrolling="yes" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"
              sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <p>First, consider a scenario where we want to add another fortune. While we could edit our original
              array, it would be simpler and more mutable to do so using <code>.push()</code>.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">fortunes.push(&quot;I wouldn&apos;t if I were you.&quot;)</code></pre>
            <p>Run this, then <code>console.log</code> the array to see your results.</p>
            <p>Of course, after &quot;pushing&quot; that, we have 9 fortunes. We could easily remove that
              fortune
              using <code>.pop</code>.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">fortunes.pop()</code></pre>
            <p><code>Console.log</code> your array again.</p>
            <p>In another scenario we might want to add that fortune to the front and remove the last one,
              &apos;very doubtful&apos;, from our list. We could combine the methods <code>.unshift</code> and
              <code>.pop</code> to accomplish this.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">fortunes.unshift(&quot;I wouldn&apos;t if I were you.&quot;) // &lt;- move to front
fortunes.pop() // &lt;- delete last item</code></pre>
            <p>This example might feel somewhat silly, but hopefully you can start to see how these methods
              might
              be helpful in a larger codebase where editing the original array is unfeasible or impossible.</p>

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <h3 id="introduction-to-objects">Introduction to Objects</h3>
            <p>In the last lesson, we introduced Arrays. Arrays are containers that hold collections of data. In
              this lesson, we will introduce another data container, the Object. Objects and arrays are similar
              in
              some ways and very different in others. Where arrays hold multiple items related to each other,
              Objects will hold a lot of information about one thing. Objects are instantiated (created) by
              using
              braces (<code>{}</code>).</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const newObj = {};</code></pre>
            <h3 id="keyvalue-pairs">Key:Value pairs</h3>
            <p>Objects use a concept called key:value pairs to house data (unlike arrays, which have index
              valued
              items). The key is the identifier and the value is the value we want to save to that key. The
              syntax
              is &quot;key: value&quot;. Objects can hold many key:value pairs. They must be separated by a
              comma
              (no semi-colons inside of an object!). Keys are unique in an object. There can be only one key of
              that name. Although, multiple keys can have the same value. Values can be any JavaScript type,
              string, number, Boolean, array, function or even another object. In this demo, we will create a
              user
              object.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const user = {
        username: &apos;dan.frehner&apos;,
        password: &apos;abc123&apos;,
        lovesJavascript: true,
        favoriteNumber: 42,
    };</code></pre>
            <h3 id="accessing-values">Accessing Values</h3>
            <p>Once we have key:value pairs, we can access those values by calling the object name and the key.
              There are two different ways to do this, dot notation and bracket notation.</p>
            <p>With dot notation, we call the object name, a dot, and the key name, similar to the
              <code>.length</code> property on an array (hint: the length property is a key:value pair!):
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    user.lovesJavascript; // true
    user.username;        // dan.frehner</code></pre>
            <p>Bracket notation is just like calling an item on an array, although with brackets we MUST use a
              string or number, or variable pointing to a string or number. Each key can be called by wrapping
              it
              with quotes:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const passString = &apos;password&apos;; //save key string to global variable
    user[&apos;lovesJavascript&apos;]; // true
    user[&apos;username&apos;];        // dan.frehner
    user[passString];        // abc123</code></pre>
            <iframe data-src="https://repl.it/@sunjieming/Objects?lite=true" height="400px" width="100%" scrolling="yes"
              frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true"
              sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Check For Understanding:</strong> What would happen if we removed the line <code>const
                passString = &apos;password&apos;;</code>? Test your theory above.</p>
            <p>In the wild, you will see brackets almost always being used with variables.</p>
            <h3 id="assigning-values">Assigning Values</h3>
            <p>We can assign values when we create the object, or later on with dot or bracket notation. Other
              than syntax, assigning values works just like assigning variables.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const newUser = {
        isNew: true,
    }
    const loveJSString = &apos;lovesJavascript&apos;;
    newUser.username = &apos;new.username&apos;;
    newUser[&apos;password&apos;] = &apos;12345&apos;;
    newUser[loveJSString] = true;</code></pre>
            <h2 id="removing-properties">Removing Properties</h2>
            <p>If we want to remove a property, we can do it using the <code>delete</code> keyword:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const newObject = {
        removeThisProperty: true,
    };
    delete newObject.removeThisProperty;</code></pre>
            <p>It is rare we will see the use of the <code>delete</code> keyword. Many consider it as best
              practice to set the value of a keyword to <code>undefined</code>. It will be up to you when the
              time
              comes.</p>
            <h2 id="follow-along">Follow Along</h2>
            <p>Let&apos;s look at an application of objects in a different context, biology. A little background
              knowledge, if you don&apos;t remember high school biology (we don&apos;t blame you) - every known
              organism on earth is classified using the Linnaean taxonomy system: a kingdom, phylum, class,
              order,
              family, genus, and species.</p>
            <p>Our challenge today will be to create an object containing all of the classification data for a
              great white shark. Consider the keys and values below.</p>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>

                </tr>
              </tbody>

            <p>We need to create an object called <code>greatWhiteShark</code> and add everything in the
              classification column as a key, with everything in the name column as a value.</p>
            <p>Syntactically, we&apos;ll declare a new object with <code>const greatWhiteShark</code>, then add
              keys and values with the syntax we learned above - <code>key: value,</code>. For the first
              key:value
              paid, that will look like <code>kingdom: &apos;Animalia&apos;,</code>.</p>
            <p><em>Note:</em> Since JavaScript identifies <code>class</code> and <code>order</code> as keywords,
              we&apos;ll need to name our properties differently. For consistency, we&apos;ll use the prefix
              <code>my</code> - creating <code>myKingdom</code>, <code>myPhylum</code>, and the like.
            </p>
            <p>Declare <code>greatWhiteShark</code> below and add classification data.</p>

            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">greatWhiteShark.myKingdom // returns Animalia</code></pre>
            <p>If we wanted to add to our <code>greatWhiteShark</code> object, we can do so using dot notation.

            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <h3 id="properties-and-methods">Properties and Methods</h3>
            <p>Think of a method as a function that is the value in an object&apos;s key:value pair. For
              example,
              when calling <code>Math.pow(2, 2)</code> we are actually referencing a function that is assigned
              to
              the key <code>pow</code> on that <code>Math</code> object. Similarly, <code>pow(2,2)</code> would
              throw a ReferenceError unless there was a function in scope named <code>pow</code>.</p>
            <p>Primitive data types (and other data types) have built-in method functionality as well. These
              extend the functionality of the primitive data types and allow us to gather information about
              them,
              or manipulate them in some way. <code>.pop</code>, for example, is a method that acts on the array
              data type. Both properties and methods will be accessed using the <code>dot notation</code> where
              we
              give the name of the variable, a dot, then the name of the property or method.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">  objectName.methodName();</code></pre>
            <h4 id="properties">Properties</h4>
            <p>Properties allow us to access data from a data type. There are many different properties on every
              data type that will give you a bit of information about that specific object.</p>
            <p>One we will look at here is the <code>length</code> property of a <code>string</code>. It will
              give
              us the length of the string, as in how many characters are in the string (spaces count).</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">  const school = &apos;Lambda&apos;;
  school.length; //6</code></pre>
            <h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
            <p>Methods allow us to manipulate a data type. Methods are different from properties in that they
              need
              to have parentheses on the end. Its important to note that methods are just functions and in order
              to invoke a function you use parentheses. The parentheses don&apos;t make it a method, in other
              words.</p>
            <p>The method we will look at here is the <code>toString</code> method. It will convert a Number or
              Boolean to a string.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">  const num = 42;
  num.toString(); //&quot;42&quot;</code></pre>
            <h3 id="global-objects-and-methods">Global objects and methods</h3>
            <p>JavaScript has a number of built-in objects for us to use. These <code>global</code> objects
              extend
              the functionality of the language for us for free. We have already seen, and have been using, the
              console object and its method <code>log</code>. Another one of these objects is <code>Math</code>.
              <code>Math</code> has a number of methods on it just like <code>console</code> has
              <code>log</code>.
              To add to this, some of our data types also have built-in methods.
            </p>
            <p>There&apos;s no purpose in trying to memorize all of the properties and methods associated with
              primitive or built in data types. Instead, focus on understanding how they work and getting
              comfortable with their unique use cases.</p>
            <h4 id="methods-1">Methods</h4>
            <p>In addition to built in methods, we can create methods inside objects. We have used plenty of
              methods so far throughout this course. We can set a key to a name, and the value to a function.
              Just
              like other times we call methods, we will call this method using dot notation and trailing
              parentheses. <code>.length</code>, <code>.push</code>, <code>.pop</code>, etc., are all methods
              created this way. (note: we can call a method with arguments just as we would a normal function):
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const newObject = {
        sayHiMethod: function() {
            console.log(&apos;Hi Everyone!&apos;);
        },
    }
    newObject.sayHiMethod(); // Hi Everyone!</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Check For Understanding:</strong> Create a method on the <code>person</code> object that
              returns a greeting</p>
            <h3 id="forin-loops">for&#x2026;in Loops</h3>
            <p>Sometimes we want to iterate over each key:value pair <strong>in</strong> our object. With
              arrays,
              we used a standard for loop and an index number variable. Objects do not contain numerical indexes
              so the standard loop will not work for objects. JavaScript has a second type of for loop built in
              called the &quot;for&#x2026;in&quot; loop.</p>
            <p>The syntax of the &quot;for&#x2026;in&quot; loop is slightly different from our first for loop,
              and
              thankfully, a bit more intuitive. After the <code>for</code> keyword, in parentheses, we will
              declare a variable (<code>let variableName</code>), use the keyword <code>in</code>, and then
              state
              the name of the object. This will loop over each key in the object and finish when all of the keys
              have been iterated over. We can use this key, and bracket notation, in our for loop to access the
              value associated with that key.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const user = {
        username: &apos;dan.frehner&apos;,
        password: &apos;abc123&apos;,
        lovesJavascript: true,
        favoriteNumber: 42,
    };
    for (let key in user){
        console.log(key);
        console.log(user[key]);
    }
    // username
    // &apos;dan.frehner&apos;
    // password
    // &apos;abc123&apos;
    // lovesJavascript
    // true
    // favoriteNumber
    // 42</code></pre>
            <h3 id="the-this-keyword">The &apos;this&apos; Keyword</h3>
            <p>Objects have a self-referential keyword that may be applied in each object called
              <code>this</code>. When called inside of an object it is referring to that very object.
              <code>this</code> can be used to access other keys in the same object, and is especially useful in
              methods:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">    const user = {
        username: &apos;dan.frehner&apos;,
        password: &apos;abc123&apos;,
        lovesJavascript: true,
        favoriteNumber: 42,
        userSaysHi: function(){
            console.log( this.username + &apos; says hi!&apos;);
        },
    };
    user.usersaysHi(); // &apos;dan.frehner says hi!&apos;</code></pre>
            <p>Note: the <code>this</code> keyword can sometimes be one of the more difficult topics in
              JavaScript. We are using it very basically here, but the topic gets much more complex very soon.
              We&apos;ll dig into that later on.</p>

            <h3 id="objects-in-javascript">Objects in JavaScript</h3>
            <p>In this lesson, we learned what Objects are and the many ways to access values, call methods, and
              assign values. Many of these techniques looked very familiar, as if we had used them in virtually
              every aspect of our learnings so far. There is a pattern here, that is because just about
              everything
              in JavaScript is an Object. Arrays are just objects with numerical keys, Strings are objects under
              the hood with built in methods, functions are actually objects with their own special properties,
              the entire JavaScript runtime is an object (<code>window</code> in a browser, or
              <code>global</code>
              in Node.js). The more you work with JavaScript, the more this will start to make sense to you.
              Just
              remember, (almost) everything is an object. The only exceptions to this rule are primitive data
              types (<code>false</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>undefined</code>, and the like).
            </p>
            <h2 id="follow-along">Follow Along</h2>
            <p>An organism&apos;s scientific name is their genus plus their species with a space in between.
              Returning to our great white shark example, we can create a method called
              <code>getScientificName</code> that will return the genus and species combined.
            </p>
            <p>While we could add a property called <code>scientificName</code> and assign it the value
              &quot;Charcharodon charcharias&quot; we don&apos;t want to do that because it would create
              redundancies in our code. Any change to genus or species would also require a change the
              scientificName property, which isn&apos;t very <code>DRY</code>.</p>
            <p>Creating this method is very similar to creating a property. We start by declaring the function
              name, <code>getScientificName</code>, add a colon, <code>:</code>, and proceed to declare the
              function like we would anywhere else.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">getScientificName: function() {

            <p>The body of the function is going to include a reference to the genus and species which we can
              create using the <code>this</code> keyword to reference the local genus and species variables such
              that scientific name will have the value <code>Genus species</code>, or in <em>this</em> case,
              <code>Charcharodon charcharias</code>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">getScientificName: function() {
    scientificName = this.myGenus + &apos; &apos; + this.mySpecies;
    return(scientificName)
}</code></pre>
            <p>Add the method above and confirm that Calling <code>greatWhiteShark.getScientificName()</code>
              will
              run our method on the greatWhiteShark object and return the scientific name <code>Charcharodon
                charcharias</code>.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const greatWhiteShark = {
    myKingdom: &apos;Animalia&apos;,
