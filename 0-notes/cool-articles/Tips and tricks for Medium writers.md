**Create lists.** You can start a bulleted list by typing a dash or asterisk. Then, just start typing your first item. Once you hit Enter, the list will be reformatted for you automatically. To start a numbered list, type “1.” and your first item.

**Two types of quotes.** Select any text in the editor and click on the quote icon in the menu to make it a block quote. Click the icon _again_ to make it a pull quote.

**Drop caps.** Select the first letter of a paragraph, and an option to turn it into a drop cap will appear in your formatting menu.

**Mention people.** Type @ and then the name of the person you want to mention. Mentioning someone will link to their profile and send them a notification when you publish.

**Embed social media posts.** You can embed a tweet or Facebook post in your story by pasting in its link and pressing Enter.

**Embed other Medium stories.** You can embed another Medium story by pasting in its link and pressing Enter.

**Embed videos.** You can embed videos from sites like YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook by pasting in any video link and pressing Enter.

**Embed audio.** You can embed audio from sites like Soundcloud or Spotify by pasting in any audio link and pressing Enter.

**Keyboard shortcuts in the editor.** Use the Medium editor like a pro: Press Ctrl+? or ⌘+? while editing to see the list of keyboard shortcuts.

**Leave yourself TK notes.** Write “TK” anywhere in your story as a placeholder and reminder to yourself to finish something later. Medium will warn you if you have any TKs left before you hit Publish.

**Use code blocks.** For technical writers, you can include inline `code blocks` in your story by putting text between backticks. To include a separate code block or snippet, type three backticks into the editor.

**See word count.** In the Medium editor, select the entire story (Ctrl+A or ⌘+A) or any passage to see the word count at the top of the page.

**Write or edit from mobile.** Download [Medium’s iOS app](https://medium.com/m/app) or [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medium.reader&hl=en) and write — or edit — on the go.

Images
------

**Image options.** In the Medium editor, click on any image to bring up the menu that allows you to change its size and position.

**Image grids.** You can create an image grid if you insert two or more images in your Medium story at the same time. Do this by holding Ctrl/⌘ or Shift while selecting image files.

**Drag and drop images.** You can drag and drop an image — or multiple images at once — from your desktop or other windows to place them in your story.

**Link images.** Click on an image in the editor and press Ctrl+K or ⌘+K to turn the image into a link.

**Feature an image on your story.** In the “Publish” drop-down menu, you can select which of the hi-res images from your story is featured in previews. Or select an image and hit “Shift+F.”

Publishing your story
---------------------

**Revision history.** Click on the \[…\] in the upper right corner of the editor, and then on _Revision history_ to see the version history of your story. You can then view or revert to an earlier version of your story.

**Publish as unlisted.** You can publish a story [as unlisted](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/215552778-Unlisted-publishing) on Medium. It will be visible only to those who have its link, and it won’t appear on your profile or on Medium’s public pages. Click on the \[…\] button in the upper right corner of the editor, and then click _Manage unlisted setting_. Choose an option and click _Save_.

**Customize title and subtitle of your story.** After finishing your story, click the \[…\] button and select _Title/subtitle._ Select _Custom title._ Choose _Custom title_, input your custom display title, and then click _Save_. You must have a title, but a subtitle is optional.

Checking on/Influencing your story’s impact
-------------------------------------------

**Feature a story on your profile.** Click on the down arrow next to any story on your profile page to [feature it](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004747067-Your-profile-page) so that it occupies the top spot. If you don’t select one to feature, our system will choose a popular one for you.

**Tag a story.** [Adding relevant tags](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214741038-Tags) to your post will help tell readers and our curators what your story is about. You can add up to five tags per story.

**Your stats page.** Go to [your stats page](http://medium.com/me/stats) to see an up-to-date summary of how your stories are doing (including the number of people who viewed, read, and clapped for them). Click on the story title or “Details” to go to a page with more information about the story’s performance, including top referrers of readers to your story.

**See the conversation about your story on social media.** You may see Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn as a referrer in the list of external referrals on a story’s stats page. If you click on the link, you can see tweets and posts about that particular story on those social media sites.

**Text shots.** Use [text shots](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214455808-Share-on-social-media) to share the best parts of your story on Twitter. Stories shared with text shots have been shown to have 3–5x more engagement than stories without them.

Input/output
------------

**Share your draft to get feedback.** To generate a link to your draft, click on the \[…\] button in the upper right corner of the editor, and then click _Share draft_. Using this link, others will be able to read your draft (and even leave private notes if they have a Medium account).

**See all the applause.** On any published story, click the number next to the [clap icon](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011350967-Claps) to see a list of everyone who has applauded the story.

**Import your story from elsewhere.** Use our [import feature](https://medium.com/p/import) (accessible from the dropdown menu after clicking your avatar) to bring a story you published somewhere else to Medium automatically. You can preview and edit it before publishing. [Read more](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-post) about importing and how it relates to SEO.

**Export your stories.** At any point, you can download an archive of all your stories from the [export page](https://medium.com/me/export) (accessible from your settings).
