</a> Work on payments at W3C was supported in part by the HTML5Apps
project, and today, the project&#x2019;s team is pleased to announce that
W3C just launched the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/">Web Payments Working
Group</a>to make payments easier and more secure on the Web.</p><p>The Web payments Working Group is 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/charter-201510.html">
chartered</a>to develop standards to support a wide array of
existing and future payment methods. Standard APIs will allow users
to register payment instruments (such as credit cards or payment
services) and select the right payment type through the browser,
making payments faster, more secure, and easier, particularly on
mobile devices. The standards should also make it easier for Web
developers to integrate existing and new payment flows into their
applications.</p><p>The 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest
Group</a>, under the leadership of co-chairs Erik Anderson
(Bloomberg) and David Ezell (NACS), will continue to identify
additional areas for future standardization.</p><p>W3C 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/wpwg/2015/10/21/join-the-web-payments-working-group/">
invites organizations to participate</a> in the new Working Group.
W3C Members, including Bloomberg, Deutsche Telekom, Digital Bazaar,
ETA, Federal Reserve Bank, Ingenico Labs, MAG, NACS, Qihoo360,
Rabobank, Ripple and WorldPay have already announced their

<div class="expand_description entry-content"><p>Last week a 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/09/wcag-charter">new charter</a> for
the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG) Working Group (WG)</a>was formally approved by
W3C after having been reviewed by the W3C Member organizations. For
the first time since the finalization of WCAG 2.0 in 2008, this
charter allows the Working Group to explore ways to provide
guidelines beyond WCAG 2.0.</p><p>The 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0</a>standard
continues to be the preeminent reference for web
accessibility.&#xA0; A growing number of national and
organizational policies around the world reference WCAG 2.0,
including Canada, Australia, Japan, India, and the United States.
WCAG 2.0 holds up well today despite significant changes in
technology.</p><p>There have been some changes to the technology landscape,
however, that were not fully anticipated in the development of WCAG
2.0. Changes in how people access the Web on mobile devices require
success criteria that address those situations more specifically.
Users with cognitive and learning disabilities and users with low
vision have suggested ways in which success criteria could better
address their requirements. In recent years the WCAG Working Group
formed task forces on 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/">mobile</a> , 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/">
cognitive</a> , and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/low-vision-a11y-tf/">low
vision</a>accessibility to define requirements and candidate
success criteria for these three areas.&#xA0;New technologies on
the horizon and the rapid evolution of the underlying technologies
for&#xA0;user interaction on the Web are likely to continue to
drive the need for new guidance.</p><p>To address these needs, the WCAG Working Group has begun to
develop a framework for WCAG 2.0 extensions. These would be
separate guideline documents, to increase the amount of coverage on
particular accessibility needs. Authors and policy-makers would be
able to choose to meet the guidelines with one or more extensions,
which inherently meet the base WCAG 2.0 guidelines, while
organizations that have policies built around WCAG 2.0 alone would
not be impacted by the extensions.</p><p>The WCAG charter just approved will serve as bridge to begin
work on extensions now while we continue to define what the next
generation of 
<abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr>guidelines
will look like. The Working Group is gathering requirements that
may lead to the creation of an updated version of WCAG, or a new
set of accessibility guidelines altogether, or both. In order to
better integrate the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/components.php">components of
web accessibility</a> into a single set of guidelines, the Working
Group is exploring the possibility of merging with the Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines and User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines Working Groups. The Authoring Tool Accessibility
Guidelines Working Group (ATAG WG) has just published the completed

<a href="http://www.w3.org/blog/2015/09/more-accessible-web-authoring-with-atag-2-0/">
Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a> ; and the
User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) has just
published an updated working draft, rolling in comments from
browser vendors and others, and will be publishing the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a>as a Working Group Note soon.</p><p>WCAG 2.0 extensions and setting the stage for next-generation
accessibility guidelines means this is an excellent time to 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/participation">join the WCAG
Working Group</a>!

<dt>The HTML5Apps continues its series of interviews of European
SMEs. Today, we go to Germany, where the 
<a href="http://www.cocomore.com/">Cocomore</a>headquarters are
located. The discussion was held with Alejandro Leiva, based in the
Cocomore Spanish office in Seville, is the technical lead of mobile
and emerging technologies, and with Christian Winter, Head of
Frontend Development in Frankfurt, specialized in responsive Web
design and the optimization of interactive Web applications for
mobile devices.</dt>
</dl><dl>
<dt>
<em>Hello! Would you please describe your company, its
mission/vision and its customer audience?</em>
</dt>
<dd>Cocomore is an international agency for Marketing and IT
services with 140 employees at our head office in Frankfurt, and in
Geneva and Seville. We are developing integrated communication and
IT solutions with best practices in crossmedia, branding, CRM,
marketing automation and e-commerce.</dd>
</dl><p>Our mission and our promise are measurable results in these
particular areas, achieved using creativity and technology. Our
main focus is on projects where it comes not only to appeal to
customers, but also to create a long-term customer relationship.
Therefore, data and IT is important but above all, you need content
which is appealing, entertaining and useful for communication with
customers.</p><p>That is why Cocomore has not only designers and creative
directors, but also editors. On the basis of our four values, which
are innovation, tradition, progress and responsibility, our agency
is trusted by leading clients including: the European Union, Lilly,
Nestl&#xE9;, Procter &amp; Gamble, Merz, RTL and Sanofi. Our customer
relationships usually grow from year to year and are long-term
based.</p><dt>
<em>Can you tell us more about cross-platform mobile applications
you have worked on?</em>
</dt><dd>Cocomore has extensive experience in the implementation of
native and cross-platform apps.</dd><p>Recently, we have accomplished a project regarding a
cross-platform mobile application for Germany&#x2019;s largest drugstore
chain: dm. We developed a game app, named &#x201C;Mission Morgen&#x201D; to
support communication around sustainability topics. After the
functional concept phase was completed, we looked at which
technological approach would be best to implement the app; in
particular, we evaluated which of a pure native or hybrid app would
fit the project. For reasons of cost, time, supported devices and
the required features, we decided to go with an hybrid app.</p><p>Our technology selection has proven to be the right one: the
combination of ngCordova, AngularJS and Ionic allowed us to focus
on the important tasks as we did not need to spend much time on the
development of basic functions. Especially ionic provides an
optimal basis. With the use of AngularJS, we were able to divide
the tasks clearly and to scale optimally the frontend team. In
addition, thanks to this technological choice, we have retained
over the entire duration of the project a good code base and we
were able to integrate new modules quickly and with high quality in
the existing app. The backend development was realized on top of
Drupal. The resulting free application is available for smart
phones with the operating system iOS or Android.</p><p>As another example, Cocomore developed a pure native mobile
application for Pampers. We are currently evaluating relaunching it
as a hybrid app. Our goal is to provide updates with new features
or extensions several times a year. Regularly, we provide
information with the dynamic newsfeed on the homepage of the app
about current actions on the Web site and on Facebook
(competitions, new craft instructions, new stories to download).
The Web site and the mobile app are optimally matched: there is no
duplication of content, the app features complement the Web site
features.</p><p>Initially, when we first developed the app, we wanted to target
as many mobile devices as possible, so we designed two native apps,
one for Android an one for iOS. We have now decided to re-launch as
a hybrid app since this means a smaller development cost and the
opportunity to operate on more mobile devices.</p><p>Cocomore has realized many other mobile projects, e.g. an iPad
app for our client Fresenius. This app teaches health care
professionals in an entertaining way about the benefits of the
product OsvaRen. It is a very visual app with embedded videos and
an in-app game.</p><p>We also developed a guided product tour for the medical device
company Spine Art. It shows to surgeons the product range of
implants, how-to-videos and animated 3D visualizations of their
products.</p><p>Other projects included a career app for the HR department of a
large pharmaceutical client, a recipe database targeted at diabetes
patients to easily monitor calory intake, an ecommerce app allowing
consumers to shop diapers when waiting for the bus or tram. And
many more.</p><dt>
<em>What are your views on native vs Web apps?</em>
</dt><dd>A native app needs to be developed in specific programming
language which is determined by the operating system such as
Objective C, Swift, Java, C ++, C #, XAML. For that you need a
programmer who has knowledge of all development methods (IDE&#x2019;s
development tools, emulators, debuggers, SDK&#x2019;s, etc.) in addition
to the programming language or more software developers for each
varying operating system.</dd><p>Web apps are very different in this regard: they can be
programmed by an experienced Web developer for several different
smartphone operating systems without having unique knowledge about
the device-specific development methods. For us, with our strong
existing engineering skills in Web development, this is a huge
benefit.</p><p>Moreover, native applications are designed for an operating
system such as iOS, Windows Phone or Android, which means they run
only on these devices. Here, the different operating system
versions have to be considered, so that the correct functionality
is ensured. When a new version of the operating system is
introduced, the native app must be updated.</p><p>This does not affect Web apps. Web applications are specially
programmed HTML5 sites that recognize the mobile device and
optimize the content for representing, they run on all Web-enabled
devices.</p><p>The big drawback of Web apps is their lack of access to phone
specific functionalities like camera, microphone. Since Web apps
run in the browser of the device access to phone hardware is very
limited.</p><p>Cocomore deliberately focuses on cross-platform mobile
applications (also called hybrid apps), which help bridge the gap
between native and Web apps. This kind of application consists of a
Web app, i.e. a backend and frontend running on a server. Thereby,
the app can also be accessed by desktop browser. It is then
displayed as a normal Web site.</p><p>The second component is an app container which can be uploaded
to the various app stores. This container allows the access to the
smartphone hardware and it draws its content from the Web app.
Thereby it combines the advantages of both types of apps. In fact
those hybrid apps are build using Web technologies and with some
native code, so they can be converted via framework in a native app
container very easily. But due to their architecture leveraging the
many advantages of the Web applications, such as the cross browser
compatibility and the cost benefit, the future could be these
hybrid apps. The most important factor being here the availability
of all the native features.</p><dt>
<em>Ultimately, which considerations drive your choices between
native or Web?</em>
</dt><dd>Depending on the individual requirements, each of these
applications can be a better choice. If you want to create an app
that makes very advanced use of the hardware and has high
performance demands (execution speed, processing speed, output
speed / graphics), a native app will be the better choice. The same
applies if a high level of integration in the operating system such
as look and feel of the UI elements or interaction with other
applications is required. Also if the app should be executable
without an internet connection, the native app is a better
fit.</dd><p>A Web app is particularly advantageous regarding total cost of
ownership and implementation time. It bears comparably low
development costs and short development periods. This technology is
directly accessible via a link, so it has the ability to run on
many mobile devices and operating systems and runs on each
smartphone without installation.</p><p>In practice, the approach we currently recommend to our
customers is to have a mobile Web portal for general information
sharing, and a cross-platform hybrid app for more interactive /
engaging content.</p><dt>
<em>What is missing to do the interactive content from within the
browser, rather than going through an hybrid app?</em>
</dt><dd>There are various considerations that makes a browser-based
approach less attractive:</dd><ul class="show_items">
<li>Our customers don&#x2019;t necessarily accept that a browser-based
approach can give good enough results in terms of performance and
UI,</li>
<li>They tend to see also a &#x201C;real&#x201D; app as a better
marketing/communication channel,</li>
<li>The app tend to be for shorter-term campaign, with often a
gamification aspect, and it&#x2019;s not obvious to end-users that you
would obtain a game or game-like experience from within the
browser,</li>
<li>On the Web, our quality expectations require good results on a
much wider set of platforms that we would target with our hybrid
apps (i.e. mostly iOS and Android), and thus the more interactive
you make the Web app, the more likely you&#x2019;ll encounter bugs in
older or less advanced mobile platforms.</li>
</ul><dt></dt><dt>
<em>How do you deal with adapting the user interfaces of the apps
across devices and platforms?</em>
</dt><dd>For adapting the app across devices of various sizes and
shapes, we&#x2019;ve found that using responsive design via the Ionic
framework lets us deal quite well with the huge diversity of
devices on the market, from smartphones to tablets. There are some
issues when dealing with older Web views (esp. on Android), but it
remains overall quite manageable.</dd><p>With regard to the specific native look and feel of each
platform, we usually recommend to use a single UI paradigm across
platforms, without trying to customize it. Once you start
customizing the UI, and taking into account e.g. the inconsistent
availability of a hardware back-button between iOS and Android, it
makes maintaining the whole app workflow much more difficult.</p><dt>
<em>As an SME, what are your needs in terms of Web standards? Which
Web standard(s) are you waiting for specifically?</em>
</dt><dd>The arrival of the Push API is very exciting for us! Clearly
this will make the offering of browser-based content a lot more
attractive to many of our customers, even for the simple mobile
portal. We can&#x2019;t wait to see it adopted in more browsers, and we
already know we&#x2019;ll use it in our projects in the upcoming few
months.</dd><p>An area where we&#x2019;ve found we had to rely on specific Cordova
plugins in our hybrid developments is for media playback; for
instance, we&#x2019;ve found that playing an audio file in loop using the
basic audio capabilities of a Web view wouldn&#x2019;t work well on
mobile, and that&#x2019;s a pretty fundamental issue e.g. in a game.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve also had issues with using Web sockets in some older Web
views, but this had more to do with implementation bugs than issues
in the standard from what we&#x2019;ve determined.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve struggled for a while with storing data &#x2014; 
<code>localStorage</code>proved unreliable as the stored data could
be wiped out by the OS; but we&#x2019;ve now switched to Indexed Database
which seems to solve that issue well enough for us.</p><dt>
<em>Any other business related to mobile, Web and standards?</em>
</dt><dd>We are an agency for marketing and IT. We help our clients with
state-of-the-art technology serving a marketing purpose. This can
be CRM system implementation, Web and app development, e-commerce
platform development, data management, social media and the like.
In most of those projects, and in today&#x2019;s world, systems are no
longer independent. A very big issue is the creation of interfaces
in order to connect systems creating a technological ecosystem.
Standards around communication interfaces between systems are a
very important topic. Being in a position to shape and apply
standards is one of our motivations of being a W3C member.</dd><p>
<em>Thank you!</em>

[News Release] HTML5Apps paves the way to future W3C payment
standards and advances mobile Web standardization roadmap</a>

</div>
<div class="expand_description entry-content"><p>The two-year EU-funded 
<a href="http://html5apps-project.eu/">HTML5Apps</a>project proudly
looks back to its achievements. The project, ending in September
2015 successfully accelerated the development of standard Web
technologies required to make HTML5 apps competitive with native
apps, specifically in the areas of Web payments and rich mobile Web
APIs.
<br />
<em>[The 
<a href="https://html5appsproject.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/html5apps-pr-29sept151.pdf">
full press release</a> is available in the 
<a href="http://html5apps-project.eu/press/">Press section</a>of
this Web site].</em></p><h3>HTML5Apps initiated W3C Payments standardization work</h3><p>Payments have been identified early on as a major gap, and on
March 2014, the HTML5Apps project organized a 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/">W3C Workshop on Web
payments</a> . It immediately gathered a lot of interest from a wide
variety of stakeholders, ranging from banks, merchants, payment
service providers, mobile operators, and many others. As a result,
a 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">W3C Web Payments Interest
Group</a> was formed. Chaired by Bloomberg and NACS representatives,
the group is 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=73816&amp;public=1">
composed of 104 participants</a>who have been busy at identifying
specific standardization opportunities and building consensus on
which of these need to be addressed within W3C.</p><p>After gathering industry use cases and requirements to help
ensure that the standards developed have the ability to include
business-to-business (B2B) payments as well as financial
institution-related payments, the group proposed to standardize
APIs &#x2013; supporting functionality such as payment instrument
registration, payment initiation, and payment completion &#x2013; to
enable an automated secure foundation for future Web payments
capabilities. As a result, W3C is now in the final stages of
starting new standards work to make Web payments both easier and
more secure.</p><h3>HTML5Apps publishes mobile Web standardization roadmap</h3><p>HTML5Apps conducted a 
<a href="http://html5apps-project.eu/tag/sme-interview/">series of
interviews with European SMEs</a> to investigate their need for fast
and easy development of innovative Web-based services. As a result,
there is a need and strong support for in-progress standards around
offline access, push notifications and access to device APIs. Where
specification efforts had not started yet, the project brought them
to the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/IG/">W3C Web &amp; Mobile
Interest Group</a>to report new standardization opportunities.</p><p>&#x201C;Seeking input directly from European developers and SMEs
enabled us to better understand their challenges of using Web apps
over proprietary formats,&#x201D; explains Dominique Haza&#xEB;l-Massieux,
HTML5Apps lead. &#x201C;As a result, and to facilitate information,
coordination and participation from these developers, we maintained
a standardization roadmap tracking efforts inside and outside of
W3C.&#x201D;</p><p>For the past two years, the HTML5Apps team published, on a
quarterly basis, a roadmap entitled &#x201C;
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Mobile/mobile-web-app-state/">Standards
for Web Applications on Mobile</a> &#x201D;. Acclaimed by Web developers,
this document summarizes the various technologies developed in W3C
that increase the capabilities of Web applications, and how they
apply more specifically to the mobile context. The latest edition
of this roadmap was published in August 2015. It notably includes
additions related to emerging work such as the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/06/payments-wg-charter.html">
proposed charter for a Web Payments Working Group</a>.</p><p>

</div>
<div class="expand_description entry-content"><p>The HTML5Apps team continues its 
<a href="http://html5apps-project.eu/tag/sme-interview/">series of
SMEs interviews</a> across Europe. Today, we go to Spain, and more
precisely to 
<span class="st">Gij&#xF3;n (in Asturias, north of Spain)</span>, where
is located the startup 
<a href="http://ubiqware.net/">UbiqWare</a>. UbiqWare is
specialized in the development of cross-platform multi-device
software solutions, offering products, services, knowledge and
experience to other software companies.</p><dl>
<dt>
<em>Hello, can you tell us more about your company and its business
at a high level?</em>
</dt>
<dd>UbiqWare is a startup focused on improving the ability of other
software companies, mainly but not solely start-ups, to develop
software. More specifically, we help companies to:</dd>
</dl><ul class="show_items">
<li>Create cross-platform solutions, including back-end, thus
providing final users with access via the Web browser (desktop,
mobile and, in general, any form factor) and mobile apps (mainly
based on 
<a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a>, but also
applying native development when required);</li>
<li>Adopt agile methodologies that facilitate success in software
projects, regardless of their complexity. We propose tools such as
the Atlassian suite (JIRA, JIRA Agile, Confluence, etc.) or other
free alternatives, such as Redmine. We put a strong focus on
continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment. For
this, we use DevHaven, our solution for continuous integration and
delivery with a special focus on cross-platform development, with
initial support for Apache Cordova projects, and plans for Grails,
native iOS, native Android and Web projects soon.</li>
</ul><dt>
<em>What is your experience in developing cross-platform mobile
applications?</em>
</dt><p>Part of the team is coming from the R&amp;D department of 
<span class="st">Fundaci&#xF3;n CTIC</span>. We worked in projects
involving development under native and (desktop-only, responsive
and mobile-first) Web development. In the early stages of our work
in CTIC, Web and native were separated worlds. JavaME, Symbian and
Windows Mobile were the most popular technologies used, whereas
XHTML-MP and other HTML subsets and flavors were used for mobile
Web development. In particular, we worked on MyMobileWeb, an
open-source platform for browser detection which delivered the most
suitable markup (and rest of resources) formats.</p><p>Since we created UbiqWare with two other colleagues (Jorge Rom&#xE1;n
and Mario San Rom&#xE1;n, with large experience in back-end development)
in November 2015 , we worked in the following projects (while
developing DevHaven):</p><ul class="show_items">
<li>We first collaborated with a Spanish startup on a cloud service
to provide companies with a unified vision of their digital
properties and general business performance by means of the
integration of all their business metrics, Web analytics, campaigns
and social media data in a single panel. They work with quite a few
well-known international companies from a variety of industries.We
analysed the code of their Web app and created a much smoother
version that was packaged as an Apache Cordova app for iPad, adding
offline capabilities. Thanks to their Web development skills, they
are creating a universal iOS version and an Android version, both
for mobile and tablet devices.We are now starting another project
improving the way in which they organize their code and software
development methodology, trying to take them to a single codebase
that finally generates Web apps and mobile apps. This company is
the first user of DevHaven, in its current internal stage.</li>
<li>Support for a Web development company in mobile apps creation.
They have designed Web sites and applications for public
institutions or consulting companies. Following increased requests
from customers to create a mobile app in addition to a Web
application or site, they chose UbiqWare as their technology
provider and advisor to create cross-platform solutions based on
responsive Web + Apache Cordova (and the corresponding plugins and
extensions).</li>
<li>Development of a mobile video surveillance application for a
company that provides video surveillance services for large
companies. One such company has started to complement their fixed
video surveillance system with the use of a mobile application by
their security guards. The first version of the application was
developed for iPad, under a native development approach. An Android
version for tablets is expected to be requested in the next months.
This is a case in which performance suggested a native approach,
due to the requirement to display several video sources as smoothly
as possible while providing a UI with minimum response time.</li>
<li>Mobile application to manage the balance associated to NFC
bracelets used for digital payments, developed for one of the
leaders in Spain in the field of digital payments. It has been
developed in Apache Cordova.</li>
</ul><dl>
<dt>
<em>What do you think about the gap between native and Web
apps?</em>
</dt>
<dd>When the guys in Nitobi, the original company who created
PhoneGap later acquired by Adobe, were asked about the future of
PhoneGap, they said the ideal situation would be that PhoneGap
would no longer be required. They expected that the path leading to
browsers having access to native features would continue, thus
making the existence of tools such as PhoneGap (contributed to the
Apache Foundation as an open source later named Apache Cordova,
which is the foundation to PhoneGap) unnecessary.Unfortunately, the
expectations on Device APIs in Web browsers have not been fulfilled
and there are many cases in which native development is required.
Sometimes, completely using a native approach or by enhancing
hybrid technologies with native plugins.</dd>
</dl><p>It is also true that the operating systems and browsers makers
are reducing the gap. Apple used a different JavaScript engine in
their UIWebView native component, much slower than the one used by
Mobile Safari. Their new WKWebKit is much faster. Google has
recently provided Chrome&#x2019;s WebView component in Android as an
independent software piece than can be updated separately of Chrome
itself and is focusing on improving its performance. Google also
encourages other Android browsers makers to release their own
WebView components, so technologies such as Apache Cordova allow
developers to choose which WebView to use.</p><p>In addition, more powerful processors, larger memory chips and
faster secondary storage technologies are included in newer
devices. This reduces the difference in the perception of
performance for human beings, between Web applications and native
applications.</p><p>This is something that has been evolving day after day since the
creation of hybrid development approaches. Therefore, the amount of
business cases in which hybrid development can compete with native
development is increasing. This is the reason why development teams
with skills in responsive or mobile-first Web development dare to
start with the release of mobile applications via app stores.</p><p>And this is the reason why the first platform to be supported in
DevHaven is Apache Cordova. Web developers focus on HTML, CSS and
JavaScript + knowing the Cordova plugins required to enhance
functionality. DevHaven stops them from dealing with requiring an
OS X to build for iOS, Windows to build for Windows Phone,
installing and updating Xcode, Android SDK and Visual Studio,
etc.</p><dt>
<em>Which platform you prefer to rely on: native or Web? and
why?</em>
</dt><dd>We rely on Web development, including hybrid development with
Apache Cordova. We only go for native if absolutely required, as
you have seen in our experience in cross-platform development.</dd><dt>
<em>How do the requests and needs from your customers affect your
choices in this space?</em>
</dt><dd>From the development point of view, customers with the
sufficient technical knowledge to have an opinion about it, they
would like that Web technologies allowed potentially any kind of
project, as a means to code once and execute in as many platforms
as possible and therefore reduce development and maintenance
costs.From those requesting our service DevHaven, they find that a
service that let them focus on Web development by reducing the
attention that they would need to pay to things as compilers, SDKs,
etc. is really useful.</dd><p>But in general, our customers want both a responsive Web app and
a presence on the app store, for which an hybrid app (sometimes,
but not always built upon the responsive Web app) is required.
While we believe in the Web as a universal platform, our customers
are not quite convinced yet!</p><dt>
<em>What are your needs in terms of Web standards? Which Web
standard(s) are you waiting for specifically?</em>
</dt><dd>A complete Device API stack. I know it is not easy, but it&#x2019;s
free to ask 
<span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile" title=":)">
:)</span></dd><p>This would stop us developers from requiring Cordova plugins,
although Cordova (or similar solutions) would still be necessary in
order to generate the mobile app.</p><p>The APIs for which we call upon Cordova plugins the most
frequently are:</p><ul class="show_items">
<li>file and file-transfer plugins, to implement local caches and,
thus, offline access to information;</li>
<li>device plugin, to harvest device information for conditional
functionality or for analytics purposes;</li>
<li>and push-messaging plugin to send remote notifications.</li>
</ul><p>

home of the

predominantly young and male dominated. The survey results also
show that most developers manage to be involved in several areas of
development, via a hobby or side project in addition to their
professional work.</p><p>

<div class="expand_description entry-content"><p>The Internet Society (ISOC) just released its 
<a href="http://www.internetsociety.org/gir">second annual Global
Internet Report</a>, with a focus this year on the mobile Internet.
The report explores mobile Internet availability, affordability,
and relevance to potential users, and highlights opportunities as
well as challenges to ensure all users can enjoy the full benefits
of mobile access to the open Internet.</p><p>The HTML5Apps team contributed significantly to the report in
two key sections of this report which are related to:</p><ul class="show_items">
<li>the challenges presented by the current app ecosystem</li>
<li>the recommendations to address these challenges based on the
work W3C is undertaking</li>
</ul><p>These contributions were depending on the work conducted earlier
by the project on the 
<a href="http://w3c-webmob.github.io/gap-analysis/">native/Web gap
analysis</a> and on the 
<a href="https://github.com/w3c-webmob/web-api-gap">API gap
review</a>.</p><p>

<div class="expand_description entry-content"><p>I was present at the 
<a href="https://edgeconf.com/2015-london">Edge conference</a>on 27
June in London, UK, representing the HTML5Apps project. That
conference, organized by FT Labs for the past 5 years, targets
discussion and debate of leading-edge use of client-side Web
technologies. It aims at being very participative in its nature,
and was organized this year around a set of panels in the morning
and breakouts in the afternoon.</p><p>About 180 developers attended the conference, including renowned
developers, technical evangelists and standards advocates.</p><p>The context of the conference (&#x201C;leading edge&#x201D;) and its attendees
made it indeed a great place for conversations and interactions.
Specifically, I had good discussions related to:</p><ul class="show_items">
<li>Interest and adoption around some of the arrival in mobile
browsers, esp. push notifications, installable Web app (via
manifest) and offline via ServiceWorker. In particular, these
technologies seem to open up to great &#x201C;conversion rates&#x201D; of
installing Web apps via a manifest compared to the native
installation workflow enabled by traditional banners &#x2014; the notion
that installing a Web app is a much smoother and less intrusive
action seems to have teeth.</li>
<li>Publishers think that the Web remains a critical part of the
traffic they get on mobile, and that the notion of 
<a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">
progressive apps</a>coined by Alex Russell matches well with the
experience these publishers are facing with native.</li>
</ul><p>On the organized sessions of the conference themselves, I
attended/participated to:</p><ul class="show_items">
<li>The panel on security, with good conversations on the needs and
issues of adopting a higher base-level security (with HTTPs and
CSP);</li>
<li>The panel on front-end data, which illustrated some of the
tensions between providing the right low-level primitives (in this
case indexedDB) and providing an easy-to-use API;</li>
<li>The &#x201C;installable web apps&#x201D; breakout, which was a really good
discussion on the model enabled by 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/">App Manifest</a>, as
well as some of the questions that remain open about it: Chrome
chose to make &#x201C;installing&#x201D; something offered to the user under some
conditions (serviceworker, repeated usage, responsiveness), where
Opera is investigating surfacing that option more visibly in the
UI; can these appmanifests help surface mobile Web apps in native
stores (where users have been trained to look for content and
services)? &#x201C;Installing&#x201D; a Web app is really &#x201C;adding it to
homescreen&#x201D;, but that means they remain a 2nd class citizen in a
number of ways (integration in app lists, integration in app
settings, etc). This was my preferred session of the day;</li>
<li>A breakout on network operators where the Natasha Rooney from
GSMA was looking for input and feedback on how developers see
operators could be useful to their goals, with a lot of discussion
similar to the topics in the 
<a href="https://github.com/w3c-webmob/networking-tf-charter">Web
&amp; Mobile Interest Group networking task force</a>.</li>
</ul><p>Overall, this developer conference was a success and the
project&#x2019;s team is looking forward to the next edition!</p><p>

<div class="expand_description entry-content"><p>W3C is aiming&#xA0;to streamline Web Payments with new standards
that will provide a uniform way&#xA0;for merchants to integrate
payments into the Web&#xA0;with a level playing field for payment
service providers and value added services. The HTML5Apps project
initiated this work in 2014 by organizing the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/">Web Payments
Workshop</a>at the &#x201C;Bourse de Paris&#x201D; to&#xA0;discuss requirements
related to usability, security, mobile payments, digital wallets,
ubiquitous payments, the Internet of Things, and more.</p><p>The 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/">Web Payment Interest
Group</a> ,&#xA0;formed as a outcome of that workshop, is meeting
this week in New York, in the heart of the financial community, for
a&#xA0;
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/Main_Page/FTF_June2015">
three day meeting</a>&#xA0;(June 16-18) which aims to prepare the
ground for launching a W3C Working Group on Web Payments standards
later this year. The HTML5Apps project is helping stakeholders to
clarify the scope and technical direction for chartering the new
group.</p><p>On June 18, W3C will hold&#xA0;a&#xA0;
<em>Future of Web Payments Industry Roundtable</em>, hosted by
Bloomberg. Participants at the Roundtable includes&#xA0;
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=73816&amp;public=1">
representatives from W3C&#x2019;s Web Payments IG</a>, including Apple,
Bloomberg, Deutsche Telekom, Gemalto, Google, Mozilla, NACS,
Rabobank, Ripple Labs, Target, US Federal Reserve Bank, Walmart,
