Your database is an RDS instance running SQL Server with Multi-AZ replication and you have several older .NET console utilities that perform database operations every 15 seconds. When the cluster has to switch the primary database server to the secondary AZ, the .NET utilities start to report connection failures to the database although other applications are able to access the database. How do you correct this problem?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Use the RDS console to force a reboot of the database instance so that the primary server becomes the master server again.</li>
<li>[ ] The server running the .NET utilities is caching the DNS lookup on the database cluster address. Flush the DNS cache of the server and force the C# utilities to open new connections to the database.</li>
<li>[ ] A.NET application will retain the IP address of a connection string until the host machine is rebooted.</li>
<li>[x] The NET utilities need to change the SQL Server endpoint in the connection strings to read from the secondary database server using a try/catch.</li>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Use RDS for SQL Server and create the same instance in two different regions. Use Database Migration Service to keep each database in sync.</li>
<li>[ ] Use a VPN or VPC peering to establish a connection between the VPCs in each region. Install SQL Server Enterprise Edition on EC2 instances in each region and configure an Always On availability group.</li>
<li>[x] Use RDS for SQL Server 2016 or 2017 Enterprise Edition. Enable Multi-AZ support and select the Mirroring/Always On option. Select another region for the mirroring option.</li>
<li>[ ] You can not set up an active-active architecture for SQL Server that spans geographic regions.</li>

<ul>
<li>[ ] PostgreSQL cannot be replicated across regions. Restore the database backups from an S3 bucket and repoint your database connections to the new instance.</li>
<li>[ ] Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. You can designate a new master database from any of the read replicas until the regional failure is resolved.</li>

What's the best practice for horizontally scaling a legacy ASP.NET web application that relies on Active Directory and is currently deployed to a single Windows EC2 instance?</h4>
<ul>
<li>[x] Use Sysprep to shut down the instance during a maintenance window. Create an AMI image and place both servers behind Application Load Balancer with sticky sessions.</li>
<li>[ ] Launch a new EC2 with the latest version of Windows Server and install the application again. Use Application Load Balancer and sticky sessions to balance between both servers.</li>
<li>[ ] Create a clone of the server using an AMI image and user Application Load Balancer to balance the traffic between both instances using sticky sessions.</li>
<li>[ ] Horizontal scaling is not the best practice in this situation. Increase the size of the existing EC2 instance and vertically scale the application.</li>

<ul>
<li>[ ] RDS will automatically increase the allocated space by 10% and will send the AWS root account an email with resolution steps. Allocate more space to avoid overage charges.</li>
<li>[x] The database instance will report a STORAGE_FULL status and become inaccessible if the instance does not have enough remaining storage to operate. Allocate more space to the instance.</li>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Use a Network Load Balancer to distribute the traffic across your servers. Use UDP health checks to determine if the server is available to receive traffic.</li>
<li>[x] Use Route 53 with HTTP health checks. Create an application on the server to report the readiness status of the vendor-provided server software to Route 53 via HTTP.</li>

<ul>
<li>[ ] The outbound rules block UDP port 53, so the server will not be able to resolve any DNS lookups.</li>
<li>[x] The outbound rules do not allow for HTTP traffic to leave the instance, so inbound HTTP requests will fail because the clients will never get HTTP responses.</li>
<li>[ ] The incoming SSH port should not be open to the public. Limit SSH to a single IP address or IP range of controlled addressed, or use a VPN to access the VPC for this server.</li>

<p>Ubuntu EC2 instance configured as a web server?</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] All traffic on all ports is being denied into this instance, which overwrites the HTTP rule and makes it redundant.</li>
<li>[ ] The instance was launched with the default security group, but there is no way for an administrator to SSH into the instance. Add another rule that allows for SSH access from a secured source, such as a single IP or a range of managed IP addresses.</li>
<li>[ ] There is nothing wrong with this security group rule. Assuming that sg-269afc5e is applied to other resources that are properly secured, this rule allows all traffic to pass through that is also assigned security group sg-269afc5e.</li>
<li>[ ] ?&gt; All traffic on all ports are allowed into this instance. This exposes the instance to all public internet traffic and overwrites the incoming HTTP rule.</li>

<p>the report with a link to download it. What is the best practice for storing the report data in S3?</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Create a public S3 bucket. When your application creates the report object in S3, generate two randomly generated long folder names and place the file within the deepest subfolder. Set the retention policy on the object to one hour and email this link to the user. The link will be active for one hour.</li>
<li>[ ] Create a public S3 bucket. Use a hash of the user's email address and the date and time the report was requested to generate a unique object name. Email this link to the user and have a scheduled task run within your application to remove objects that are older than seven days.</li>
<li>[x] Create a private S3 bucket. The link in the email should take the user to your application, where you can verify the active user session or force the user to log in. After verifying the user has rights to access this file, have the application retrieve the object from S3 and return it in the HTTP response. Delete the file from the S3 bucket after the request is completed.</li>
<li>[ ] Create a private S3 bucket. The link in the email should take the user to your application, where you can verify the active user session or force the user to log in. Set the report object in S3 to public. Show the user a "Download" button in the browser that links to the public object.</li>
