<p>For this the correct option should be <strong>Attributes apply only to a specified object, behaviors apply to other linked objects</strong></p>
<p>Attributes are the individual things that differentiate one object from another and determine the appearance, state, or other qualities of that object.</p>
<p>A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will "react" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes.</p>
<p>For Example: A motorcycle class might include the following attributes and have these typical values ( That are specific):</p>
<ul>
<li>Color: red, green</li>
<li>Style: cruiser, sport bike</li>
<li>Brand: Honda, BMW</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some behaviors that the Motorcycle class might have (applied to other linked objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the engine</li>
<li>Stop the engine</li>
<li>Speed up</li>
<li>Change gear</li>
</ul>
